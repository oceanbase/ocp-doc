# Create a standalone centralized database

The standalone centralized mode is a streamlined database architecture of OceanBase Database. Compared with a distributed cluster, a standalone centralized database requires only one host and is easy to deploy and ready to use. However, without multiple replicas and scaling capabilities, a standalone centralized database is only suitable for development, testing, and business systems that do not require high data security.

This topic describes how to create a standalone centralized database.

## Prerequisites

* You have logged on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console with an account that has the permission to create clusters.

* Only OceanBase V4.1.0 and later support this deployment mode.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console, and find the entry to cluster creation based on the actual business scenario.

   1. If you do not have a manageable cluster, the system displays a message on the **Clusters** page, prompting you to create one. Click **Create Cluster** in the prompt.

   2. If you already have a manageable cluster, go to the **Clusters** page, and then click **Create Cluster** in the upper-right corner.

2. In the **Create Cluster** dialog box, select **Standalone Centralized**.

3. Set the basic information of the cluster.

   The following table describes the fields in the **Basic Settings** section.

   | Field | Description |
   |-----|-------|
   | **Cluster Name** | The name of the cluster to be created. The cluster name must be 2 to 48 characters in length and can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and underscores (_). The cluster name must start with letters.  |
   | **root@sys Password** | This password can be customized or randomly generated.  The password must meet the following complexity conditions:<ul><li>The length is 8 to 32 characters.</li><li>The password contains at least two uppercase letters, two lowercase letters, two digits, and two special characters. </li><li>The supported special characters are \~!@#%\^\&\*_-+=\`\|(){}\[\]:;',.?/ </li></ul> |
   | **OceanBase Version** | You can select an OceanBase Database version from the drop-down list or click **Add Version** at the bottom of the list to upload an OceanBase Database version.  |
   | **Zone Name** | You can retain the default name or define a custom name.  A zone name must consist of 2 to 48 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and underscores (_), and start with a letter.    |
   | **Host** | Select a host that has the same architecture as that of the selected OceanBase Database version. The selected host runs both the observer and rootserver processes. If no host is available in the drop-down list, you can click **Add Host** in the drop-down list to add a host.  |

4. Enable **Parameter Settings** and configure related cluster parameters.

   * You can add startup parameters one by one and set values as shown in section ① of the following figure.

   * You can also click **Select Parameter Template** as shown in section ② of the following figure and select a parameter template. The system will automatically populate parameters in this section by using the template.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>If you use OceanBase Database V2.2.77, we recommend that you use the built-in <strong>2.2.77 Version Parameter Template</strong>. This template contains general parameters of OceanBase Database V2.2.77. You can configure a cluster based on this template.</li>
    <li>If no cluster parameter template is available, you can click <strong>Create Cluster Template</strong> to create one. For more information, see <a href="../1200.cluster-parameters-template-management.md">Manage cluster parameter templates</a></li>
    </ul>
    </main>

5. Enable **Custom Settings** to configure paths and ports.

   * Configure the paths:
      1. In the **Path Settings** section, specify the **Software Installation Path, Data Disk Path**, and **Log Disk Path** as needed.
      2. Click **Test** to check whether the paths can be used. If a path cannot be used, you can perform troubleshooting based on the test results, or use another path.

   * Configure the ports:
      1. In the **Port Settings** section, specify **SQL Port** and **RPC Port** as needed.
      2. Click **Test** to check whether the ports are occupied. If a port is occupied, you must use another port.

6. After the test succeeds, click **Submit**.

7. Confirm the information in the right-side panel, and click **OK**.

8. In the **Note** dialog box, specify whether to create a user tenant.

   * If you do not need to create a tenant, click **Skip**. In this case, only the cluster is created. For more information about how to create a user tenant, see [Create a tenant](../../500.quickstart/600.quickstart-create-a-tenant.md).
   * If you need to create a tenant, set the tenant mode and tenant name. After the configuration is complete, click **Create and Submit**. You can choose **System Management \> Tasks** to view the progress of the task.

      The following table describes the parameters.

      | Parameter | Description |
      |-----|-------|
      | Tenant Mode | The mode of the tenant. Default value: **MySQL**. |
      | Tenant Name | The name of the tenant, which is the same as the tenant mode by default. You can use a custom name instead.   |
