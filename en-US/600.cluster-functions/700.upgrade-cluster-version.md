# Upgrade an OceanBase cluster

This topic describes how to upgrade an OceanBase cluster in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. The upgrade process of OceanBase Database varies based on its version. For more information about the upgrade process of a specific version, visit the [official website of OceanBase Database](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/oceanbase-database-cn).

## Precautions

* You must log on to the OCP console with an account that has the permissions to manage the cluster.
* A cluster of a version earlier than OceanBase Database V4.0 can be upgraded only to a version earlier than V4.0.
* Optional. To upgrade OceanBase Database earlier than V2.2.60, you must define an upgrade path in the `/home/admin/ocp-server/etc/oceanbase_upgrade_dep.yml` file of OCP. The upgrade path must be similar to the following example. The parameter configuration method is described at the top of the file.

   ```yaml
   ### Omitted.
   - version: 2.2.70
     can_be_upgraded_to:
         - 2.2.71
   - version: 2.2.71
     can_be_upgraded_to:
         - 2.2.72
   - version: 2.2.72
     can_be_upgraded_to:
         - 2.2.73
   - version: 2.2.73         # The target version must completely appear in this format, including the two lines below:
     can_be_upgraded_to:
         - 2.2.74
   ```

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>The preceding example shows that OceanBase Database can be upgraded from V2.2.72, V2.2.71, V2.2.70, and earlier to V2.2.73, but not to V2.2.74. </p>
   </main>

* All RPM packages required for the upgrade have been uploaded, such as oceanbase-x.x.x-YYYYMMDDhhmmss.el7.x86_64.rpm or oceanbase-x.x.x-YYYYMMDDhhmmss.el7.aarch64.rpm.
* If tenants in the cluster are in primary/standby relationships:
  * If the cluster of a standby tenant associated with the primary tenant in the current cluster is of a version earlier than that of the current cluster, to avoid data synchronization exceptions between the primary and standby tenants, we recommend that you first upgrade the cluster of the standby tenant, or  switch the primary tenant in the current cluster to a standby tenant. For more information about how to perform a switchover, see <a href="../1200.manage-disaster-recovery/100.switching-primary-and-standby-tenants/">[Switchover](../1200.manage-disaster-recovery/100.switching-primary-and-standby-tenants/100.daily-active-standby-tenant-switchover.md)</a>.
  * We recommend that you keep the cluster versions of the primary and standby tenants the same.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Clusters** page.

3. In the **Clusters** list, find the target cluster and click its name.

   The **Overview** page of the cluster automatically appears.

4. On the **Overview** page, click the **More** icon in the upper-right corner and select **Upgrade Version**.

   The **Upgrade Version** page appears.

   * The **Cluster** parameter displays the OceanBase cluster to be upgraded.

   * Set the **Upgrade Method** parameter based on your business requirements. Valid values of this parameter:

      * **Rolling Upgrade (recommended)**: Your business is not interrupted during the upgrade.

      * **Downtime Upgrade**: Your business is interrupted during the upgrade. Proceed with caution. If your cluster has less than three zones, the majority of zones cannot be formed in rolling upgrade. In this case, we recommend the downtime upgrade method.

   * Select the target OceanBase Database version from the drop-down list of the **Upgrade Version** parameter.

      If the RPM package for the target version does not exist in the list, you can click **Add Version** at the bottom of the list to upload the target RPM package.

   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p><ul>
   <li>A <b>standalone centralized</b> database supports only the <b>Downtime Upgrade</b> mode. </li>
   <li>You can select only a version that is later than the current version. </li>
   <li>After you select a version, the system checks whether the installation package for the hardware architecture of the current cluster exists. If no, the upgrade cannot be performed. </li>
   </ul></p>
   </main>

5. Click **Upgrade**.

   * If an error message prompts that the upgrade path from version xxx to version xxx is not found, you must first define the upgrade path in the `oceanbase_upgrade_dep.yml` file as described in the Prerequisites section of this topic.

   * If the configurations are correct, the **Confirm xxx Upgrade Path** dialog box automatically appears.

      In the dialog box, verify whether the RPM packages exist for all the specified versions. If not, click **Upload** to upload the RPM packages as required.

6. Click **OK**.

   In the dialog box that appears, you can click **View Task** to view the upgrade progress.

   If the task status is **Completed**, and this cluster in the **Clusters** list on the **Clusters** page is in the **Running** state, the cluster is successfully upgraded.

   <h4>Notice</h4>
   <p>OCP does not allow you to roll back the upgrade of an OceanBase cluster. Do not manually skip any upgrade steps or roll back the upgrade. </p>
   </main>

7. View upgrade tasks.

   The upgrade task is divided into multiple subtasks based on the upgrade nodes.

   * In the upgrade task, each upgrade node whose binary file needs to be replaced along the upgrade path is handled by a subtask.
      In this example, `Submit cluster upgrade task` indicates that a subtask is created, and `Wait dag success` indicates that the system is waiting for the subtask to complete. `Submit cluster upgrade task` and `Wait dag success` come in pairs and may appear many times. The number of occurrences depends on that of upgrade nodes where the binary files are replaced.

   * After all the subtasks are completed, the OceanBase cluster is upgraded to a later version. Subtasks execute the following upgrade scripts: precheck script, pre-upgrade script, OBServer node replacement script, post-upgrade script, and version check script.
