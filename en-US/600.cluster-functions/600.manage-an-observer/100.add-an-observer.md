# Add an OBServer node

You can add OBServer nodes to a cluster that you manage to scale it out.

## Prerequisites

* The logged-on user in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console has the permission to **update** the target OceanBase cluster.

* The target OceanBase cluster is managed in the current OCP cluster.

   Otherwise, you need to use the current OCP cluster to take over the OceanBase cluster. For more information, see [Take over a cluster](../300.manage-a-cluster/400.take-over-a-cluster.md).

* The target is not a **standalone centralized** database.

## Add OBServer nodes to clusters

You can perform the following steps to add OBServer nodes to multiple zones at a time.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Clusters** page.

3. In the **Clusters** list on the page, find the target cluster and click its name.

4. In the upper-right corner of the **Overview** page, click **Add OBServer**.

5. In the **OBServer Information** section, specify the type and IP address of the host of one or more OBServer nodes that you want to add. Then, set startup parameters for the OBServer nodes.

   * If you do not need to add an OBServer node to a zone, click the **Delete** icon of the corresponding zone to remove the zone.
   * For more information about the startup parameters of OBServer nodes, see [OceanBase Database parameters](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-1000000000218691).

6. Click **OK**.

   In the dialog box that appears, click **View Task** to view the progress.

   You can also choose **System Management > Tasks** to view the progress.

   When the task enters the **Completed** state, and the status of the OBServer nodes is displayed as **Running** in the **OBServers** list on the **Overview** page, the task succeeds.

## Add one or more OBServers node to a zone

You can perform the following steps to add one or more OBServer nodes to one zone.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Cluster** page.

3. In the **Clusters** list on the **Clusters** page, find the target cluster and click its name.

4. On the **Overview** page, find the row of the target zone in the **Zones** list, and click **Add OBServer** in the **Actions** column.

5. In the **OBServer Information** section, specify the type and IP address of the host of one or more OBServer nodes that you want to add. Then, set startup parameters for the OBServer nodes.

   * By default, one OBServer node will be added. To add more OBServer nodes, click **Add OBServer**.
   * For more information about the startup parameters of OBServer nodes, see [OceanBase Database parameters](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-1000000000218691).

6. Click **OK**.
