# Stop an OBServer service

This topic describes how to stop an OBServer service.

## Prerequisites

* You have the permission to **Update** a cluster with the current account.

* Your OceanBase cluster is managed in the current OCP cluster.

   Otherwise, you need to use the current OCP cluster to take over your OceanBase cluster. For more information, see [Take over a cluster](../300.manage-a-cluster/400.take-over-a-cluster.md).

* (Optional) If you don't want to affect the business when the OBServer is stopped, you need to have other OBServers in the zone where the OBServer to be stopped is located, and ensure sufficient resources. At this point, stop the OBServer, and the Unit will automatically switch to other OBServers, thus not affecting the business.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**. The cluster overview page appears.

3. On the Clusters page, find the target cluster that includes the OBServer you want to stop in the **Clusters** list and click its name. The **Overview** page of the cluster appears.

4. In the **OBServers** list,  choose **Stop Service**.

5. In the dialog box that appears, click **Stop** to stop the OBServer service.

   In the dialog box, you can click **View Task** to view the progress.

   You can also choose **System Management > Tasks** to view the progress of the task.

   When the task status is **Completed** and the status of the OBServer is **Stopped** in the **OBServers** list on the **Overview** page, the OBServer is stopped.
