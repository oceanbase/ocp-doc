# Add a zone

You can add zones to a cluster that you manage.

## Prerequisites

* The logged-on user in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console has the permission to **update** the target OceanBase cluster.

* The target OceanBase cluster is managed in the current OCP cluster.

   Otherwise, you need to use the current OCP cluster to take over the OceanBase cluster. For more information, see [Take over a cluster](../300.manage-a-cluster/400.take-over-a-cluster.md).

* The target is not a **standalone centralized** database.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Clusters** page.

3. In the **Clusters** list on the page, find the target cluster and click its name.

4. In the upper-right corner of the **Overview** page, click **Add Zone**.

5. In the dialog box that appears, set the zone information.

   By default, only one zone is added. You can click **Add Zone** to add more zones.

   The following table describes the parameters required for setting the zone information.

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Zone Name | The name of the zone.  |
   | IDC | The IDC where the zone is located.  |
   | Host Type | Optional.  If you select a host type, the host list is filtered based on the host type.  |
   | CPU Architecture | The CPU architecture of the host in the zone must be the same as that of the cluster. <br>After you select an architecture, the system checks whether an installation package for the CPU architecture of the current cluster exists. If the installation package for the specified architecture does not exist, the zone cannot be added.  |
   | Host | The IP address of the host. You can select multiple IP addresses. In a production environment, we recommend that the size of the log disk be at least three times that of the memory size of the host. To avoid performance issues, we recommend that you do not create the data directory and the log directory on the same disk.  |
   | Parameter Configurations | The startup parameters of all OBServer nodes in the zone. For more information, see [OceanBase Database parameters](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-1000000000218691). <br>If you do not specify the OBServer node startup parameters, the startup parameters specified when you created the cluster are used.  |

6. Click **OK**.

   In the dialog box that appears, you can click **View Task** to view the creation progress.

   You can also choose **System Management > Tasks** to view the progress.

   When the task enters the **Completed** state, and the status of the zone is displayed as **Running** in the **Zones** list on the **Overview** page, the zone is created.
