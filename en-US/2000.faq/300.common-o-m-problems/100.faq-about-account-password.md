Accounts and passwords
-------------------------

**Q1: What do I do if I forget the password of the admin user?**

A: You can use another account that has the OCP user management privileges to change the password of the admin user.

**Q2: What are the account and password for logging on to OCP?**

A: The default account for logging on to OCP is `admin` and the default password is `aaAA11__`. We recommend that you change the password of the admin user after you log on OCP for the first time.
