# View cluster overview information

A tenant is a logical concept that represents a resource allocation unit in OceanBase Database. It is the basis for the management of database objects and resources. It is critical for system O&M, especially for the O&M of cloud databases. After you log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console, you can click **Tenants** in the left-side navigation pane to go to the **Tenants** page, where you can obtain the tenant overview information. By default, the page displays a list of tenants that you have the permission to view, and displays performance monitoring charts of top 5 tenants.

On the **Tenants** page, you can see a **Tenants** list and charts of **Top 5 Tenants**. You can also perform tenant management operations on this page. For more information, see [Unit specification management](../700.tenant-functions/400.manage-unit-specification.md), [Create a tenant](../500.quickstart/600.quickstart-create-a-tenant.md), [Lock a tenant](600.manage-a-tenant/300.locked-a-tenant.md), and [Copy a tenant](600.manage-a-tenant/200.replication-a-tenant.md).

## Tenants

The **Tenants** list displays the information of each tenant in columns such as **Tenant Name, Cluster, OceanBase Database Version, Tenant Mode, Zone Priority, Read-only, Locked, Status, Created At**, and **Actions**. You can search for multiple tenants at a time by specifying their names separated with spaces.

* You can click the name of a tenant to go to its **Overview** page. For more information, see [Overview](600.manage-a-tenant/100.overview-of-the-tenant-details-page.md).

* You can sort tenants by the **Cluster** column. In addition, you can click the name of a cluster to go to the tenant management page of the cluster. For more information, see [Overview of the Cluster Details page](../600.cluster-functions/300.manage-a-cluster/200.overview-of-the-cluster-details-page.md).

* When a tenant is in the **Maintaining** state, you can click **View Task** in the **Actions** column to go to the task details page of the tenant. On the task details page, you can perform operations such as viewing task logs, rolling back a task, and retrying a task. For more information, see [Manage tasks](../1600.system-management-features/100.manage-tasks.md).
