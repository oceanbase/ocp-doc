Check after installation
=============================================

After you deploy OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Community Edition, you can check the OCP features, log files, OCP version, time, and Docker container to verify whether OCP Community Edition is installed as expected.

Verify the Docker container
------------------------------------------------

After you deploy OCP, perform the following operations:

* Run the `docker stats ocp` command to verify the status, CPU utilization, and memory usage of the Docker container.



* Run the `docker exec -it ocp bash` command to access the Docker image console. Then, run the `pgrep -a java` command to verify that the java process is running properly and JVM startup parameters meet your expectation.






Verify OCP logon
-------------------------------------

1. Enter the OCP access URL in the address bar of your browser and press the Enter key.

   ```shell
   http://<hostip>:<port>/login
   ```



2. Enter the OCP username and password on the logon page.

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>The username is admin, and the default password is root. To ensure account security, we recommend that you change the default password after you log on for the first time. For more information, see <a href="../300.ob-cloud-platform/300.userguide-features/800.user-center/200.change-the-logon-password.md">Change your logon password</a>.</p>

Verify OCP features
----------------------------------------

After OCP is deployed, refer to the User Guide and verify that the following features are available:

* Configure the alerting channel to verify that it is available.



* Verify the basic features, including importing hosts, creating clusters, creating tenants, and viewing monitoring data.



* Configure alert subscription to verify that the subscription feature is available.






Verify the log file
----------------------------------------

* Verify that the ocp.log file is stored in the `/home/admin/logs/ocp` directory.



* Verify that no error is contained in the `ocp.log` file.






Verify the OCP version
-------------------------------------------

Run the following command to query the OCP-Server version. If the value of buildVersion in the response matches the OCP-Server version, the OCP-Server version is correct.

```shell
curl --user <username>:<password> 'http://<OCP_HOST>:<OCP_PORT>/api/v2/info'
```



* username: the username of the OCP administrator. The username is admin.



* password: the password of the admin user. The default value is root.






Verify the clock time
------------------------------------------

Run the following command to query the OCP-Server time. If the time in the response is correct, the clock of OCP-Server functions properly.

```shell
curl 'http://<OCP_HOST>:<OCP_PORT>/api/v2/time'
```
