System architecture 
========================================

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) consists of six modules: Management Agent, Management Service, Metadata Repository, Monitor Repository, Management Console, and OBProxy. 

The following figure shows the system architecture of OCP.

The OCP system consists of the following modules:

* Management Agent

  




Management agents are typically installed on hosts (including physical and virtual hosts) monitored in a computing environment. These agents are deployed and upgraded in the OCP console in a unified manner. They are used to start and stop target hosts, remotely run tasks, and collect metrics, and provide detailed information such as availability, metrics, and task status to OCP management services. 

* Management Service

  




Management services are large Java-based applications. They communicate with the management agents and the metadata repository to collect and store information on remote hosts. They can also communicate with OceanBase clusters to remotely run maintenance commands on OceanBase Database. 

* Metadata Repository

  




A metadata repository, also known as metadata database or MetaDB, is used to store all information collected by the management agents. The metadata repository stores information about target hosts, database clusters, tenants, database instances, database users, scheduling tasks, and software versions. 

Before you install OCP, make sure that a metadata repository already exists. 

* Monitor Repository

  




A monitor repository, also known as monitoring database or MonitorDB, is used to store the monitoring data collected by OCP. The monitor repository stores the performance metrics and the statistical and diagnostic information of hosts, clusters, tenants, sessions, and SQL statements. 

* Management Console

  




The management console provides a user interface for accessing, monitoring, and managing all database clusters. It also provides some useful data dashboards that allow you to view important information directly after logging on. 

* OBProxy

  




OBProxy is a reverse proxy service for connecting to OceanBase Database. It routes requests sent to the databases from OCP management agents to the cloud information clusters and sends the responses to OCP management services.
