Overview of the Cluster Details page
=========================================================

On the details page of a cluster, you can view its basic information, resource usage, alerts, system events of the last 7 days, zones, and OBServers, and can perform routine cluster maintenance.

**View the basic information**

The table in the OBServers section contains the following columns: **IP, Port, IDC, Zone, Host Type, Available Resources, Status** , and **Actions** . The Actions column provides the following options: **Restart, Stop, Replace, Delete** , and **Download Logs** . For more information, see [Restart an OBServer](../../400.manage-clusters/300.basic-operations/800.manage-the-observer-cluster/300.cluster-restart-observer.md), [Stop an OBServer](../../400.manage-clusters/300.basic-operations/800.manage-the-observer-cluster/500.cluster-stop-observer.md), [Replace an OBServer](../../400.manage-clusters/300.basic-operations/800.manage-the-observer-cluster/700.cluster-replace-observer.md), [Delete an OBServer](../../400.manage-clusters/300.basic-operations/800.manage-the-observer-cluster/900.cluster-delete-observer.md), and [Download logs](../../400.manage-clusters/300.basic-operations/1500.download-log.md).

**Cluster management**
-------------------------------------------

You can also perform other cluster management operations on the Cluster Details page. For more information, see [Add a zone](../../400.manage-clusters/300.basic-operations/700.manage-cluster-zones/100.userguide-create-zone.md), [Create a tenant](../../400.manage-clusters/300.basic-operations/900.cluster-create-a-tenant.md), [Upgrade the cluster version](../../400.manage-clusters/300.basic-operations/1100.userguide-upgrade-version.md), [Change the password of the sys tenant](../../400.manage-clusters/300.basic-operations/1300.userguide-change-password.md), [Restart a cluster](../../400.manage-clusters/300.basic-operations/600.restart-a-cluster.md), [Delete a cluster](../../400.manage-clusters/300.basic-operations/300.delete-a-cluster.md), [Disable SQL collection](../../400.manage-clusters/300.basic-operations/1600.cluster-disable-sql-collection.md), and [View the SQL collection history](../../400.manage-clusters/300.basic-operations/1800.cluster-view-the-sql-collection-switch-history.md).

In the left-side navigation pane, you can also find the routine clusters maintenance features. For more information, see [View the cluster topology](../../400.manage-clusters/400.userguide-view-the-cluster-topology.md), [Performance monitoring](../../400.manage-clusters/800.cluster-performance-monitoring.md), [Cluster resource management](../../400.manage-clusters/1000.cluster-resource-management.md), [Major compaction details](../../400.manage-clusters/1100.merge-management/300.cluster-merge-details.md), and [View parameters](../../400.manage-clusters/1200.parameters/100.cluster-view-the-parameter-list.md).

Protection mode
------------------------------------

Maximum performance: It protects user data and maximizes the performance of the primary cluster. In this mode, the log transfer between the primary cluster and all standby clusters is asynchronous.

Maximum availability: Normally, the primary cluster keeps synchronous log transfer with only one standby cluster.

Maximum protection: The primary cluster keeps synchronous log transfer with only one standby cluster, and asynchronous log transfer with other standby clusters.

Switch between clusters
--------------------------------------------

To view the general information of another cluster, click the cluster name field in the upper left corner on the **Overview** page, and select the target cluster from the drop-down list.
