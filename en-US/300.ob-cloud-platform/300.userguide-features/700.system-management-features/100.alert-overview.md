Alert overview 
===================================

This topic describes how OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) generates alerts and sends notifications when an exception is detected in an OceanBase cluster or application. 

Overview 
-----------------------------

OCP provides alerting and monitoring services for OceanBase clusters, tenants, and the resources that they depend on so that you can detect business operation failures and resource shortages as soon as possible.

Manage alert events 
----------------------------------------

On the Alert Events tab, you can search for an alert event by the subscription method and alert source. For more information about subscription methods, see [Alert subscription settings](../800.user-center/300.alert-subscription-configuration.md). ![10131653](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/7914306461/p338404.png)

Click **Show** . Then, you can search by keyword, cluster, tenant, server, alert status, alert level, start time, or end time. 

You can view details of a specific alert in the alert event list, including the alert message, alert ID, cluster, tenant, alert generation time, recovery time, and last alert time.
