Copy a user 
================================

To create a user similar to an existing one, you can copy the existing user, and then configure the settings that are different. 

**Prerequisite** 
-------------------------------------

You are logged on with an account that has the ADMIN or USER_MANAGER role.

Procedure 
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** **\>** **Security** .

   

3. On the **User Management** tab, click **Copy** in the **Actions** column. 

   Edit the user information. For more information about the parameters, see [Create a user](../1000.using-system-management/500.create-user.md). 

   You must modify the following fields in the **Basic Information** section: **Username** , **Password** , and **Email Address** .
