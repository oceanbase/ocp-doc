   All tasks that match the criteria will be displayed in the **Tasks** list.
   

4. Click the name of a task to go to its details page. 

   By default, the task details page is displayed in log view. You can switch to flow view by clicking the button shown in Area 1 in the following figure. 

   The log view displays logs of ongoing tasks. You can switch it in Area 2 in the following figure. If a task is retried or rolled back after the `Prepare upgrade cluster` step fails, Area 2 displays three buttons for execution, retry, and rollback, respectively. You can click a button to open its operation logs.

5. On the task details page of the flow view, you can click the **More** icon on the right of a step, and then click an action in the list that appears. Different steps support different actions, so the actions displayed in the list after you click the **More** icon (...) are not always the same. This action is also supported in log view. 

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>On the task details page, the <strong>flow view</strong> shows the sequence of different steps in a flowchart. Drag the pointer in an empty area to move the flowchart. Scroll to zoom in and out. You can also use the zoom control in the upper-right corner to adjust the canvas size. The center of zooming is the pointer. For a long task, you can first zoom out, locate the node of interest, and then zoom in from there.</p>
  </main>
   * You can query logs of successful nodes. 

     Expand the menu to display the log information in the lower part of the screen. You can drag edges of a window to expand it.
     
   
   * For failed steps, you can perform the following operations: 

     * View the logs.

       
     
     * Rerun: Rerun the step. The operation will be first rolled back, and then performed again. If the operation is successful, subsequent steps are performed.

       
     
     * Set to Successful: After you set the status of a failed step to successful, subsequent steps are performed.

       
     

     
   
   * For steps that are running, you can view the logs or terminate them. After you terminate a running step, its status becomes failed.

     
   
   * For steps that are waiting to be performed, you can do nothing.

   * Abort Task: Roll back each step from the failed step all the way back to the first step. Task abortion is mainly used for resource recollection and status modification.
