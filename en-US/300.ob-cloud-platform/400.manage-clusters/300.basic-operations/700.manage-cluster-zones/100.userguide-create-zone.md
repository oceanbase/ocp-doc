Create a zone 
==================================

You can add zones to a cluster that you manage. 

Prerequisites 
----------------------------------

* The logged-on user in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console has the permission to **update** the cluster.

  

* Your OceanBase cluster is managed in the current OCP cluster. 

  Otherwise, you need to use the current OCP cluster to take over your cluster. For more information, see [Take over a cluster](../1.takeover-cluster.md).
  




Procedure 
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console. 

   The **Clusters** page automatically appears. 

   The **Cluster Overview** page automatically appears.
   

2. In the **Clusters** list on this page, find the target cluster and click its name.

   

3. In the upper-right corner on the **Overview** page, click **Create Zone** .

   

4. In the dialog box that appears, set the zone information. 

   By default, only one zone is added. You can click **Add** to add more zones. 
   
  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The hardware architecture of the hosts in the zone must be the same as that of the cluster.</p>
  </main>
