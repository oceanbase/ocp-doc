Stop a zone
================================

This topic describes how to stop a zone. Stopping a zone also stops all OBServers in the zone. Proceed with caution.

Prerequisites
----------------------------------

* The logged-on user in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console has the permission to **update** the cluster.



* Your OceanBase cluster is managed in the current OCP cluster.

  Otherwise, you need to use the current OCP cluster to take over your cluster. For more information, see [Take over a cluster](../1.takeover-cluster.md).


* Check whether the zone to be stopped hosts the leader replica of the tenant. If yes, make sure that a full-featured replica of the tenant is available. Otherwise, stopping the zone will cause business interruptions.






Procedure
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

   The **Cluster Overview** page automatically appears.


2. In the **Clusters** list on this page, find the target cluster and click its name.



3. In the **Zones** list, find the row that contains the target zone, and click **Stop** in the **Actions** column. ![1](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/2004306461/p399107.png)



   A dialog box appears, asking you to confirm whether to stop the zone.


4. In the dialog box, click **Stop** .

   In the dialog box, you can click **View Task** to view the progress.

   You can also choose **System Management \> Tasks** to view the progress of the task.

   When the task status is **Completed** , and the status of the zone is **Stopped** in the **Zones** list on the **Overview** page, the zone is stopped.


5. Optional. If you want to use the zone again, find it in the **Zones** list, and click **Start** in the Actions column. ![1](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/2004306461/p399166.png)
