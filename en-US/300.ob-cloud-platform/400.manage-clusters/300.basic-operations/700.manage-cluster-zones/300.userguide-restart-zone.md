Restart a zone
===================================

This topic describes how to restart a zone. Restarting a zone also restarts all OBServers in the zone. Proceed with caution.

Prerequisites
----------------------------------

* The logged-on user in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console has the permission to **update** the cluster.



* Your OceanBase cluster is managed in the current OCP cluster.

  Otherwise, you need to use the current OCP cluster to take over your cluster. For more information, see [Take over a cluster](../100.takeover-cluster.md).





Procedure
------------------------------

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>If the zone to be restarted hosts the leader replica of a tenant, the businesses of the tenant may be suspended during the restart.</p>
  </main>

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

   The **Cluster Overview** page automatically appears.


2. In the **Clusters** list on this page, find the target cluster and click its name.



3. In the **Zones** list, find the row that contains the target zone, and click **Restart** in the **Actions** column.

   A dialog box appears, asking you to confirm the restart.


4. In the dialog box, click **Restart** .

   In the dialog box, you can click **View Task** to view the progress of restart.

   You can also choose **System Management \> Tasks** to view the progress of the task.

   When the task status is **Completed** , and the status of the zone is **Running** in the **Zones** list on the **Overview** page, the zone is restarted.
