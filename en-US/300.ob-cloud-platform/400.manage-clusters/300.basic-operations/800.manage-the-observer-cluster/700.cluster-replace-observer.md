Replace an OBServer
========================================

This topic describes how to replace a low-performance OBServer with one that provides higher performance.

Prerequisites
----------------------------------

* The logged-on user in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console has the permission to **update** the cluster.



* Your OceanBase cluster is managed in the current OCP cluster.

  Otherwise, you need to use the current OCP cluster to take over your cluster. For more information, see [Take over a cluster](../100.takeover-cluster.md).


* We recommend that you replace an OBServer only when your OceanBase cluster has at least three replicas.






Procedure
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

   The **Cluster Overview** page automatically appears.


2. In the **Clusters** list on this page, find the target cluster and click its name to go to the **Overview** page of the cluster.



3. In the **OBServers** list, find the row that contains the target OBServer, and click **Replace** in the Actions column. ![1](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/7004306461/p399401.png)



4. In the dialog box that appears, select a new host and click **Replace** .

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>You can only select a host that matches the hardware architecture of the current cluster, and is in the same IDC as the OBServer to be replaced.</p>
  </main>

   In the dialog box that appears, you can click **View Task** to view the progress of replacement.

   You can also choose **System Management \> Tasks** to view the progress of the task.

   When the task status is **Completed** , and the status of the new OBServer is **Running** in the **OBServers** list on the **Overview** page, the original OBServer is replaced.
