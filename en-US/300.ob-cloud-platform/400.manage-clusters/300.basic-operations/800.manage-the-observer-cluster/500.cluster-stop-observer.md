Stop an OBServer
=====================================

This topic describes how to stop an OBServer.

Prerequisites
----------------------------------

* The logged-on user in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console has the permission to **update** the cluster.



* Your OceanBase cluster is managed in the current OCP cluster.

  Otherwise, you need to use the current OCP cluster to take over your cluster. For more information, see [Take over a cluster](../1.takeover-cluster.md).


* Optional. To stop the OBServer without business interruptions, make sure that other OBServers are available in the same zone, and have sufficient resources.

  In this case, when the OBServer is stopped, the resource unit on it can be automatically switched to another OBServer.





Procedure
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

   The **Cluster Overview** page automatically appears.


2. In the **Clusters** list on this page, find the target cluster and click its name to go to the **Overview** page of the cluster.



3. In the **OBServers** list, find the row that contains the target OBServer, and click **Stop** in the Actions column.

   In the dialog box, you can click **View Task** to view the progress.

   You can also choose **System Management \> Tasks** to view the progress of the task.

   When the task status is **Completed** , and the status of the OBServer is **Stopped** in the **OBServers** list on the **Overview** page, the OBServer is stopped.
