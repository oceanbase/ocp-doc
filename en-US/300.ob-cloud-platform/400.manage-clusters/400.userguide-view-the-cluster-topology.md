View the topology of a cluster 
===================================================

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) provides a topology diagram that allows you to view the logical relationships between zones and OBServer nodes in a cluster or tenant. 

In the **Clusters** list on the **Clusters** page, select the target cluster and click its name. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Topology** to go to the cluster topology page. 

* You can see the protection mode information in the upper-left corner of the page. For more information, see [Cluster overview](../300.userguide-features/100.cluster-features/200.overview.md).

  

* For a standby cluster, you can also see its synchronization status.

You can use the functional buttons in the upper-right corner of the page to resize or refresh the topology. 

The topology consists of three layers from top to bottom: cluster, zone, and server. You can click **+** beneath the zone to show all servers in the zone. 

**Cluster** 
--------------------------------

The ID, type, and current status of the OceanBase cluster is displayed next to the cluster icon, where the type can be primary or standby. 

In the case of a standby cluster, you can also see its latency next to the cluster icon. 

The topology also provides some cluster-management functions. 

For a primary cluster, you can create a backup cluster, add a zone, add an OBServer, upgrade the version, change the password, and restart, stop or delete the cluster. For a standby clusters, you can perform operations such as viewing the cluster and switching to the primary cluster.

**Zone** 
-----------------------------

The name and current status of a zone are displayed next to the zone icon. 

You can move the pointer over a zone icon to view information about the zone, such as the QPS, number of connections, and the number of units. 

The topology also provides some zone management features that allow you to add an OBServer and restart, stop, or delete a zone.

**Server** 
-------------------------------

The IP address and current status of a server are displayed next to the server icon. 

You can move the pointer over a server icon to view the information about the server, such as the QPS, number of connections, and SQL ports. 

The topology also provides some server management features that allow you to restart, start, stop, replace, and delete a server.
