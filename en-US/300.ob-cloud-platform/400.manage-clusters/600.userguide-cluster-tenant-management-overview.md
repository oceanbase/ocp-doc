Cluster tenant management overview
=======================================================

You can view the tenant, the resource distribution information of all tenants, and monitoring data of top 5 tenants in the cluster that you manage.

**Prerequisite**
-------------------------------------

You have all permissions on the cluster and the management permissions on its tenants.

**Procedure**
----------------------------------

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

2. In the **Clusters** list on the **Cluster** page, find the target cluster and click its name.

3. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Tenant Management** .

4. You can view the resource distribution on the **Tenant Management** page. The resource distribution information includes the percentage of CPU and memory usage of each tenant, and the percentage of the remaining CPU and memory of the system.

   * When you move the pointer over the pie chart, the chart displays the resource usage of the tenant.

   * Click **Create Tenant** to create a tenant for the cluster. For more information, see [Create a new tenant](../5.manage-tenants/2.basic-tenant-operations/1.userguide-create-a-tenant.md).

6. In the **Top 5 Tenants** section, you can view the performance metrics of the top 5 tenants by workload, such as the TPS, QPS, SQL response time, transaction response time, number of active sessions, number of waits, wait time, capacity_number of tables, and capacity_number of partitions. You can also view the monitoring information of the last hour, day, or week as needed.
