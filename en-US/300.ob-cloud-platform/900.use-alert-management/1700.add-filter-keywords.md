Add a filtering keyword 
============================================

This topic describes how to add a filtering keyword so that OceanBase logs that match the keyword will not trigger an alert. 

Background 
-------------------------------

In essence, OceanBase log alerts are not triggered by alert rules, but by the monitoring of OBServer operation logs. An alert is triggered when an error log is detected. However, some error logs do not indicate a real problem. In this case, you can add a filtering keyword so that error logs with the keyword will be ignored, instead of triggering an alert.

Procedure 
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** **\>** **Alerts** .

   

3. On the **OceanBase Log Filtering** tab, click **Add Filtering Keyword** . 

   The **Add Filtering Keyword** dialog box appears.
   

4. Configure the filtering conditions as needed.

   You can use a regular expression as a keyword. Logs that match the keyword will not trigger an alert.
   

5. Click **OK** .
