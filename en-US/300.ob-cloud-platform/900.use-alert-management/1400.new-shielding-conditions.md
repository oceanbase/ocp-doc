Create a blocking condition
================================================

This topic describes how to block an alert.

Background
-------------------------------

Topics [View an alert event](../900.use-alert-management/1200.view-alert-events.md) and [View the alert notification history](../900.use-alert-management/1300.view-alert-notification-records.md) describe how to block alerts on the **Alert Events** and **Notification History** tabs. However, these methods only allow you to block alerts that have been reported, and you can only specify the duration for blocking these alerts.

This topic describes how to create a blocking condition. It is a more flexible method that allows you to block alerts before they are generated. After a blocking condition is created, the system starts to block alerts based on the condition. If the blocking condition does not take effect immediately, wait for another 30 seconds.

When you run a maintenance task on an OceanBase cluster, alerts are automatically blocked.

Procedure
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.



2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** **\>** **Alerts** .



3. On the Alert Blocking tab, click **Create Blocking Condition** .



4. Configure the blocking condition in the **Create Blocking Condition** dialog box.
