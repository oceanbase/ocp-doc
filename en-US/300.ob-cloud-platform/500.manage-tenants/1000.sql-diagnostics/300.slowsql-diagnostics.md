Slow SQL diagnosis 
=======================================

Slow SQL statements are statements whose execution time exceeds the slow-query threshold. You can use the SlowSQL diagnosis feature to identify risky statements and avoid risks. 

Set the slow query execution time threshold 
----------------------------------------------------------------

By default, an SQL query is considered a slow query if its execution time exceeds 100 ms. You can use the following method to modify the default slow-SQL threshold:

1. Use OBClient or OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) to execute the following SQL statements to change the default slow-SQL threshold to 120000 μs. 

   ```javascript
   select collect_elapsed_threshold_us from ob_agent_collection_config_history 
   where collection_name = 'slow_sql';
   update ob_agent_collection_config_history set collect_elapsed_threshold_us = 120000 where collection_name = 'slow_sql';
   ```

   

2. Change the value of the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) system parameter ocp.ob.slowsql.threshold to 120000 μs.

   




**Procedure** 
----------------------------------

1. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants** and click a tenant in the **Tenants** list to go to the **Overview** page of the tenant.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **SQL Diagnosis** . The **SQL Diagnosis** page appears. 

   The SQL diagnostic data is not displayed on the **SQL Diagnosis** page if you do not set the values of both the cluster parameter enable_sql_audit and the tenant parameter ob_enable_sql_audit to True. You can click Change Cluster Parameters in the prompt box to modify the parameter values.
   

3. Click the **SlowSQL** tab.

   

4. Filter the slow SQL statements. 

   1. Specify the filter conditions

      * Time Range: You can select the last 5 minutes, last 10 minutes, last 20 minutes, last 30 minutes, last 1 hour, and last 3 hours from the drop-down list of the **Time Range** field. You can also select Custom Time from the drop-down list and specify the start time and end time as needed. By default, the information of the last 30 minutes is displayed.

        
      
      * OBServer: You can select an OBServer or All OBServers in the list. If you select an OBServer, only SQL statements executed on the selected OBServer are queried.

        
      
      * Internal SQL: If you select this option, the SQL statements internally initiated by OceanBase Database are displayed in the query result.

        
      
      * Keywords: The SQL statements that contain the specified keywords are displayed in the query result.

        
      
      * Advanced Search: You can select **SQL ID** , **Executions** ,and **Executions per Second** from the drop-down list, and specify the values. The SQL statements matching the metric values are displayed in the query result.

   2. Click **Query** to list all the SQL statements that meet the filter conditions.

      
   

   

5. Click **Export** to export all the SQL statements in the query result.

   

6. View the information of slow SQL statements. 

   1. Click **Column Management** . In the dialog box that appears, select the columns to display. Then, you can view the selected information in the SlowSQL list.

   2. On the SlowSQL tab, you can view the columns selected. You can also copy the SQL text, filter it by database and user, and sort it by the number of executions, total response time, response time, and CPU time.

   3. You can click the SQL text to go to the corresponding SQL text page. 

      1. On the **SQL Text** page, you can **Copy** or **View All** SQL information.

      2. View SQL statement execution details: You can view the trace ID, request time, response time, execution time, physical reads, rows returned, server IP address, and client address information in the last 5 minutes, last 10 minutes, last 20 minutes, last 30 minutes, last 1 hour, last 3 hours, or a custom time range. You can copy the trace ID. You can also sort the statements by request time, response time, execution time, and physical reads. 

         Physical reads: the number of times data is read from the physical disk.

      3. View historical trends: You can view the historical trends of SQL statements for different IP addresses and time ranges.

      4. View execution plans: You can select the OBServers and time range to view details of execution plans. The table contains the following columns: **Plan Hash** , **Merged Version** , **Execution Plan Type** , **Plan Generation Time** , **CPU Time** , and **Retrieval Rate** . You can copy the **Plan Hash** string of a plan. 

         ![10281736](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/1788667361/p345513.png)

         You can click the **Plan Hash** string of an execution plan to view its details. 

         ![10281737](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/1788667361/p345514.png)

         On the details page of the plan, you can click the IP address in the Server IP column to view the execution details of the plan on this server.
         
      
      5. View index binding: You can filter the execution plans by indexing status and type. You can also click the button in the **Binding** column to bind an SQL statement to an index. You can create indexes in a command line tool or OceanBase Developer Center (ODC).

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The outline feature relies on the hint and plan cache features of OceanBase Database. The hint feature determines the selection of the physical plan generation path by specifying the index and the connection method. The plan cache caches physical plans for SQL statements. When the same SQL statement is executed again in the same environment, the system reads its execution plan from the plan cache. It does not have to go through the parser, resolver, rewriter, and optimizer modules again. This speeds up the execution of SQL statements. The outline feature uses hints to specify how to fix plans by modifying the physical execution plan in the plan cache.</p>
  </main>

         OCP allows you to bind an index to an outline. You can bind an index to an SQL ID, so that OceanBase Database selects this index when it executes the SQL statement. At present, you can bind only one index to an SQL ID. For more information, see [Plan binding](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/oceanbase-database/oceanbase-database/V2.2.30/plan-binding).
