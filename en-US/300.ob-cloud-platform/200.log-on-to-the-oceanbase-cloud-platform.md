Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform console
===================================================================

After you deploy OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), you can log on to the OCP console from its access address.

**Prerequisite**
-------------------------------------

You have obtained the OCP logon account and password from the administrator.

**Procedure**
----------------------------------

1. Enter the OCP access URL into the address bar of your browser and press the Enter key.

   OCP access URL: The access URL of the OCP application server (single-node deployment) or the OCP cluster.


2. Enter the OCP username and password on the logon page.

   * If the username or password you entered is incorrect, an error message appears, indicating the remaining logon attempts allowed and that the username or password is incorrect.

   * If the number of failed attempts exceeds the limit, the system locks the IP address of the client from which you made the failed attempts. Try again after 10 minutes. If you still cannot log on after 10 minutes, contact the administrator.

   * If you do not take any action for 30 minutes after logon, OCP automatically logs you off.


3. Click **Log On** .

   * We recommend that you change your password as soon as possible upon your first logon and properly keep your new password. For more information about operations in personal center, see **Personal center** .



   * If you logon to a follower OCP cluster in the multi-cluster mode for the first time, you need to refer to the registered OCP cluster to register the standby cluster with the primary cluster









**Subsequent operations**
