Query the performance indicator trend of an SQL statement
==============================================================================



**Description**
------------------------------------

You can call this operation to query the performance indicator trend of an SQL statement within a specified time range. The performance trend comprises multiple sampling points, and each sampling point is included in the performance indicators of a specified timestamp. You can call this operation to query SQL performance changes with time.
**Note**

If you specify a large time range, the returned sampling points may be approximate to 120.
