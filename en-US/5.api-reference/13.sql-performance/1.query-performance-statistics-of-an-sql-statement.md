Query performance indicators of an SQL statement
=====================================================================



**Description**
------------------------------------

You can call this operation to query SQL performance indicators of a tenant, and specify a time range to collect SQL performance indicators of the period. Performance data includes the cluster, tenant, server, database, user, SQL_ID, response time, CPU time, number of executions, and number of errors. You can query specified SQL performance indicators based on conditions such as whether it is an internal SQL statement, keywords in the SQL text, and advanced search conditions.


**Note**

This query takes a relatively long time. If the response is slow, you can reduce the query frequency, time range, or number of concurrent requests, check the resource usage of the OCP-Server and Monitor DB, and adjust the configuration accordingly

**Call description**
-----------------------------------------

**Prerequisite**

You have the Read-only permission on the tenant.

**Request path**

`GET /api/v2/ob/clusters/{clusterId}/tenants/{tenantId}/topSql`

  **Note**

  Only the foremost 100 characters of the SQL text are returned. To query the complete SQL text, call the SQL text query operation.





**Examples**
---------------------------------

**Sample request**

Query the SQL performance based on the cluster ID 1 and tenant ID 1001, and set the time range to 2020-11-03T19:00:00+08:00 to 2020-11-03T20:00, and set the number of executions to greater than or equal to 500.

```code
GET /api/v2/ob/clusters/1/tenants/1001/topSql?searchAttr=executions&searchOp=GE&searchVal=500&startTime=2020-11-03T19%3A00%3A00%2B08%3A00&endTime=2020-11-03T20%3A00%3A00%2B08%3A00
```



**Sample response**

The size of the returned performance data is affected by the database load and time range of the query. In the following code snippet, only two performance data records are returned.
