# Deploy OCP cluster in the Single-node

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) supports two deployment modes: single-node deployment and high-availability deployment. This topic describes how to deploy OCP on a single node.

## Overview

In single-node deployment, all OCP components are deployed on a single node. This node provides all OCP capabilities. The OCP components include OCP-Server, MetaDB, MonitorDB, and OBProxy.

This deployment mode has the following benefits:

* All services are deployed on one host, which minimizes the required resources.

* All requests are handled on one host without distributed processing, which facilitates log lookup and debugging.

* OCP depends on fewer services and does not require server load balancing.

    <p>Single-node deployment applies to scenarios with low availability and fast verification requirements. </p>

### Deployment process

This topic describes how to deploy OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) on a single node.

The deployment process is divided into four steps: planning resources, preparing the deployment environment, deploying OCP on a single node, and check after deployment, as shown in the following figure.
