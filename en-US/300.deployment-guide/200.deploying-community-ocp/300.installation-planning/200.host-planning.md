# Host planning

This topic describes the number of hosts, and the CPU and memory resources that are required to deploy OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Community Edition.

## Requirements for hosts and resources

### MetaDB

MetaDB stores persistent data other than monitoring data, and requires less resources. We recommend that you create a separate OceanBase Database tenant for MetaDB and allocate at least 4 CPU cores and 8 GB of memory to the tenant.

We recommend that you allocate CPU and memory resources to each replica of the MetaDB tenant based on the number of OBServers managed by OCP.

| **Number of managed OBServers** | **CPU (core)** | **Memory (GB)** |
|---------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| ≤ 10                            | 4              | 8               |
| ≤ 50                            | 8              | 16              |
| ≤ 100                           | 16             | 32              |
| ≤ 200                           | 32             | 64              |
| ≤ 400                           | 64             | 128             |

### MonitorDB

MonitorDB stores the performance data collected by OCP from managed objects, mainly OceanBase Database clusters. We recommend that you create an OceanBase Database tenant dedicated for MonitorDB and allocate at least 4 CPU cores and 16GB of memory to the tenant.

We recommend that you allocate CPU and memory resources to each replica of the MonitorDB tenant based on the number of OBServers managed by OCP.

| **Number of managed OBServers** | **CPU (core)** | **Memory (GB)** |
|---------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| ≤ 10                             | 4              | 16              |
| ≤ 50                             | 16             | 64              |
| ≤ 100                            | 32             | 128             |
| ≤ 200                            | 64             | 256             |
| ≤ 400                            | 128            | 512             |

### OCP

The following table describes the CPU and memory resources required for OCP-Server on the premises that each managed OBServer runs 10 tenants. You must calculate the required CPU and memory resources based on your business requirements.

| **Number of managed OBServers** | **CPU (core)** | **Memory (GB)** |
|---------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| ≤ 10                            | 4              | 8               |
| ≤ 50                            | 8              | 16              |
| ≤ 100                           | 16             | 32              |
| ≤ 200                           | 32             | 64              |
| ≤ 400                           | 64             | 128             |

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>OCP-Server requires a minimum of 4 CPU cores, 8GB of memory, and 500GB of available disk space. This configuration still applies when you need to manage only one host that runs less than or equal to 10 tenants.</p>

### Example

OCP is deployed in a Docker container. You can deploy OCP-Server, OCP-MetaDB, and OCP-MonitorDB on the same physical server. You can create different tenants in an OceanBase cluster for OCP-MetaDB and OCP-MonitorDB. The following table describes the resources required when you use OCP to manage 10 OBServers.

|   Deployment item    | CPU (core) | Memory (GB) |
|----------------------|------------|-------------|
| OCP-Server           | 4          | 8           |
| OCP-MetaDB tenant    | 4          | 8           |
| OCP-MonitorDB tenant | 4          | 16          |
| SYS tenant           | 5          | 28          |

The physical server requires 17 CPU cores and 60GB of memory.

## Requirements for operating systems
