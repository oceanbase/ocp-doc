# User planning

This topic describes the users required for the deployment of OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Community Edition.

## Users

| User |Description  |
|-------|-----|
| root  | The user for uploading software packages and granting permissions. It is a built-in user of the system. You do not need to create it. |
| admin | The business user for performing OCP operations and operations related to OCP. You need to manually create an admin user for each host. For more information, see **Create an admin user**. |

## Create an admin user

To create an admin user, you can perform the following steps:

1. Run the following commands to create the admin user:

   ```bash
   useradd -U admin -d /home/admin -s /bin/bash
   mkdir -p /home/admin
   sudo chown -R admin:admin /home/admin
   ```

2. Run the following command to set a password for the admin user:

   ```shell
   passwd admin
   ```

3. Optional. Set sudo permissions for the admin user.

   Open the `/etc/sudoers` file. Add the following code to `/etc/sudoers`:

   ```shell
   ## Same thing without a password
   # %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
   admin       ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

4. Run the following command in the `/home` directory to check whether the admin user is granted the permission to access the directory.

   ```shell
   ls -al
   ```

   The following output is returned:

   ```shell
   drwxr-xr-x 2 admin admin 4096 Feb. 9 18:43 
   drwxr-xr-x 2 admin admin 4096 Feb. 9 18:43 admin
   ```

   If the admin user does not have the access permission, run the following commands as the root user:

   ```shell
   chown -R admin:admin /data
   chown -R admin:admin /home/admin
   ```

   Note that you need to specify your actual mount directories. The `/data` and `/home/admin` directories in the preceding commands are only examples for your reference.
