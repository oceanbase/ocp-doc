Performance monitoring
===========================================

You can view the performance data of the cluster in different ways.

Procedure
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. The **Clusters** page automatically appears.



2. In the **Clusters** list on the **Clusters** page, find the target cluster and click its name.



3. In the left-side navigation pane on the page that appears, click **Performance Monitoring** .



4. In the **Data Filtering** section, you can view the performance data by performing the following steps:

   The following table describes the filter conditions.


   |                 **Condition**                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                          **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   |-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Select Time (not displayed in real-time mode) | Select a time range for the data that you want to query.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   | Stat Period (not displayed in real-time mode) | Select the statistical period for each data point. Valid values: **Per Minute** and **Per Second** , which respectively means one data point per minute and one data point per second. OCP also calculates one more statistical period based on the selected time range by increasing the number of data points to approximately 1,440. If the selected time range is long, the statistical period may be longer than one minute. |
   | Zone                                          | Select the zone that you want to view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
   | OBServer                                      | Select the OBServer that you want to view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |


   * After you specify the filter conditions, the system displays the performance monitoring data based on the selected period and statistical period.

     **Note**



     To view the trend details over a specific period, drag the pointer over the period to select this period. The system will then zoom in to display the trend details. After you view the trend details, double-click the trend chart to return to normal.


   * To view the performance data of an OBServer in real time, toggle on the **Real-time** switch in the upper-right corner and select the target OBServer.

5. You can respectively view the performance data of databases and hosts in the cluster on different tabs.

   * Click the **Database Performance** tab to view the database performance.

     To display other metrics, click **Select Metric** on the right side and select the metrics that you want to display. The system can display up to 10 metrics.


   * Click the **Host Performance** tab to view the host performance.
