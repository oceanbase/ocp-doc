Upgrade the version of an OceanBase cluster 
================================================================

This topic describes how to upgrade an OceanBase cluster through OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP). The method for upgrading an OceanBase cluster is closely related to its version. For more information, visit the official website of [OceanBase Database](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/oceanbase-database/oceanbase-database/V3.1.1/upgrade-overview), and see the Upgrade Guide for a specific version. 

Prerequisites 
----------------------------------

* You have the permission to manage the cluster.

  

* (Optional) To upgrade OceanBase Database earlier than V2.2.60, you must define an upgrade path in the `/home/admin/ocp-server/etc/oceanbase_upgrade_dep.yml` file of OCP. The upgrade path must be similar to the following example: The method is described at the top of the file. 

  ```yaml
  ### The description of older versions is omitted.
  - version: 2.2.70
    can_be_upgraded_to:
        - 2.2.71
  - version: 2.2.71
    can_be_upgraded_to:
        - 2.2.72
  - version: 2.2.72
    can_be_upgraded_to:
        - 2.2.73
  - version: 2.2.73         # The target version must completely appear in this format, including the two lines below: 
    can_be_upgraded_to:
        - 2.2.74
  ```

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The preceding example shows that OceanBase Database can be upgraded from V2.2.72, V2.2.71, V2.2.70, and earlier to V2.2.73, but cannot be upgraded to V2.2.74.</p>
  </main>
  

* All RPM packages required for the upgrade have been uploaded, such as oceanbase-x.x.x-YYYYMMDDhhmmss.el7.x86_64.rpm or oceanbase-x.x.x-YYYYMMDDhhmmss.el7.aarch64.rpm.

  




Procedure 
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console. The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

   

2. In the **Clusters** list on the **Clusters** page, find the target cluster and click its name.

   The **Overview** page of that cluster automatically appears.
   

3. Click the **More** icon in the upper-right corner of the **Overview** page, and click **Upgrade Version** . 

   The **Upgrade Version** page automatically appears.

   * The **Cluster** field displays the OceanBase cluster to be upgraded. 

     If the cluster in Step 2 is associated with primary/standby clusters, the associated primary/standby clusters are also upgraded.
     
   
   * Select the target OceanBase version from the drop-down list of the **Upgrade Version** field. 

     If the RPM package for the target version does not exist in the list, you can click **Add Version** at the bottom of the list to upload the target RPM package.
     
   

   

4. Click **Upgrade** . 

   * If an error message prompts that the upgrade path from version xxx to version yyy is not found, you need to define the upgrade path in the `oceanbase_upgrade_dep.yml` file as described in the preceding Prerequisites.

     
   
   * If configurations are correct, the **test Upgrade Path Confirmation** dialog box automatically appears. 

     In the dialog box, verify whether the RPM packages exist for all the specified versions. If not, click **Upload** to upload the RPM packages as required.
