Stop a cluster 
===================================

You can stop a cluster as needed. Stopping a cluster also stops the observer processes running on all nodes in the cluster. 

Prerequisites 
----------------------------------

* The logged-on user has the permission to manage the cluster.

  

* Stop the OceanBase cluster when the business traffic of the cluster is low.

  This is because when you stop a cluster, your businesses are interrupted, and no solution is available to avoid the impact. Proceed with caution. We recommend that you stop a cluster only when it is no longer in use.
  




Procedure 
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. 

   The **Clusters** page automatically appears. 

   The **Cluster Overview** page automatically appears.
   

2. In the **Clusters** list on this page, find the target cluster and click its name.

   

3. In the upper-right corner of the **Overview** page, click the More icon ( **...** ), and choose **Stop Cluster** .

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>Stopping a cluster also stops the observer processes running on all nodes in the cluster. Proceed with caution.</p>
  </main>
   

4. In the **Confirmation** dialog box, click **Stop** . 

   In the dialog box, you can click **View Task** to view the progress. 

   You can also choose **System Management \> Tasks** to view the progress of the task. 

   When the task status is **Completed** , and the status of the cluster is **Stopped** in the **Clusters** list on the **Clusters** page, the cluster is stopped.
   

5. Start the cluster. 

   If you want to use the stopped OceanBase cluster again, click **Start Cluster** in the upper-right corner of the **Overview** page of the cluster. ![1](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/1993306461/p399389.png)
