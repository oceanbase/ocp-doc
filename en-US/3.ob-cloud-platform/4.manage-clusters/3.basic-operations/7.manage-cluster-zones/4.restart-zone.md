Restart a zone 
===================================

This topic describes how to restart a zone. Restarting a zone also restarts all OBServers in the zone. Proceed with caution. 

Prerequisites 
----------------------------------

* The logged-on user in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console has the permission to **update** the cluster.

  

* Your OceanBase cluster is managed in the current OCP cluster. 

  Otherwise, you need to use the current OCP cluster to take over your cluster. For more information, see [Take over a cluster](../1.takeover-cluster.md).
  




Procedure 
------------------------------

> **Notice**
>
> If the zone to be restarted hosts the leader replica of a tenant, the businesses of the tenant may be suspended during the restart.

1. Log on to the OCP console. 

   The **Clusters** page automatically appears. 

   The **Cluster Overview** page automatically appears.
   

2. In the **Clusters** list on this page, find the target cluster and click its name.
