Delete a zone
==================================

This topic describes how to delete a zone from an OceanBase cluster. This operation deletes all the OBServers and data of the zone, and releases resources allocated to the host. Proceed with caution.

Prerequisites
----------------------------------

* The logged-on user has the permission to **delete** the cluster.



* Your OceanBase cluster is managed in the current OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) cluster.

  Otherwise, you need to use the current OCP cluster to take over your cluster. For more information, see [Take over a cluster](../1.takeover-cluster.md).


* Check whether the zone to be deleted hosts the leader replica of the tenant. If yes, make sure that a full-featured replica of the tenant is available. Otherwise, deleting the zone will cause irreversible business interruptions.






Procedure
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

   The **Cluster Overview** page automatically appears.


2. In the **Clusters** list on this page, find the target cluster and click its name.



3. In the **Zones** list, find the row that contains the target zone, and click **Delete** in the **Actions** column. ![1](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/3004306461/p399393.png)

   A dialog box appears, asking you to confirm whether to delete the zone.


4. In the dialog box, click **Delete** .

   In the dialog box, you can click **View Task** to view the progress of the deletion task.

   You can also choose **System Management \> Tasks** to view the progress of the task.

   When the task status is **Completed** , and the **Zones** list on the **Overview** page does not contain the zone, the zone is deleted.
