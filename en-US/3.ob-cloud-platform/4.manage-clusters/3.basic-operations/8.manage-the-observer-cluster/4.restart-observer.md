Restart an OBServer 
========================================

This topic describes how to restart an OBServer. 

Prerequisites 
----------------------------------

* The logged-on user in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console has the permission to **update** the cluster.

  

* Your OceanBase cluster is managed in the current OCP cluster. 

  Otherwise, you need to use the current OCP cluster to take over your cluster. For more information, see [Take over a cluster](../1.takeover-cluster.md).
  

* If the OBServer to be restarted hosts the only full-featured replica of a tenant, we recommend that you restart the OBServer during night hours when the business traffic is low.

  




Procedure 
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console. 

   The **Clusters** page automatically appears. 

   The **Cluster Overview** page automatically appears.
   

2. In the **Clusters** list on this page, find the target cluster and click its name to go to the **Overview** page of the cluster.

   

3. In the **OBServers** list, find the row that contains the target OBServer, and click **Restart** in the Actions column. ![1](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/5004306461/p399396.png)

   

4. In the dialog box that appears, select whether to force restart. 

   In a general restart task, a pre-check is performed before the OBServer restarts. The OBServer will not be restarted if it does not pass the pre-check.

   If the OBServer does not host businesses, you can choose to force restart. Otherwise, we recommend that you do not choose to force restart.
   

5. Click **Restart** . 

   In the dialog box that appears, you can click **View Task** to view the progress. 

   You can also choose **System Management \> Tasks** to view the progress of the task. 

   When the task status is **Completed** , and the status of the OBServer is **Running** in the **OBServers** list on the **Overview** page, the OBServer is restarted.
