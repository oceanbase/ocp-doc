Major compaction details 
=============================================

A major compaction compacts all dynamic and static data, and is time-consuming. When the incremental data generated through minor compactions reaches the specified threshold, OceanBase Database performs a major compaction of data of the same major version. This topic describes how to view the details of a major compaction. 

Procedure 
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console. The **Cluster** Overview page automatically appears.

   

2. In the **Clusters** list, find the target cluster and click its name.

   

3. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Compaction Management** .

   

4. On the **Details of Major** **Compaction** tab, view the details about the major compaction.

   The Details of Major Compaction tab shows the information about the last major compaction in the cluster. If a major compaction is in progress, the information about the ongoing major compaction is displayed. If no major compaction is in progress, the last major compaction version is displayed with details. 
   **Note**

   

   For a version in the progress of a major compaction, the estimated time required is displayed after **Start Time** and **End Time** . The estimated completion time is estimated based on the average duration of the last three major compactions, which may differ greatly from the actual completion time.

   Generally, the estimated completion time is closer to the actual completion time for a stable environment. However, for a newly deployed environment, the accuracy of the estimated completion time is relatively low due to lack of historical data for estimation. 

   In addition, you can also check the compaction progresses of partitions based on the **Total Partition Replicas** and **Replicas of Partitions After Major** **Compaction** , and then estimate the completion time. 
   **Notice**

   

   The completion time estimated based on the number of compacted partition replicas is still inaccurate, because data in different partitions may vary greatly, resulting in largely varying compaction time for the partitions.
