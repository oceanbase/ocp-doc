Major freeze statistics 
============================================

You can view the Major freeze statistics of a cluster.

Procedure 
------------------------------

1. Log on to OCP. By default, the **Cluster Overview** page appears.

   




<!-- -->

2. In the **Clusters** section of the **Cluster Overview** page, click the name of the cluster that you want to view.

   

3. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Compaction Management** .

   

4. In the **Last 3 Major Freezes** section of the **Details of Major Freeze** tab, you can view the statistics of major freeze.![1](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/7695798161/p260765.png)

   Major freeze statistics provide the following four statistical graphs for the last three major freezes:
   * Elapsed Time of Major Freeze

     
   
   * Top 5 Servers by Elapsed Time of Major Freeze

     
   
   * Top 5 Tenants by Average Minor Freezes

     
   
   * Top 5 Tenants by Peak Memory Usage Before Major Freeze

     
   

   

   The major freeze time and performance data helps you learn the health of the OceanBase cluster because major freeze affects the overall performance of the cluster.

   In most cases, we want the daily major freeze is triggered at the time point that we specify.

   If the number of times of minor freeze and memory usage exceed a specific threshold, the major freeze is triggered in a cluster. You can determine whether the resources allocated to a tenant are sufficient by viewing the metrics of the tenant. You can upgrade the resource specifications of a tenant to prevent major freeze in a cluster triggered by insufficient resources.
