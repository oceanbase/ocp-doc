Modify parameters 
======================================

You can modify the values and effective scopes of cluster parameters as needed. 

Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. The **Cluster** Overview page automatically appears.

   

2. In the **Clusters** list on the **Cluster** Overview page, find the target cluster and click its name.

   

3. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Parameter Management** .

   

4. Optional. In the search box on the **Parameters** tab, enter a parameter name to run a fuzzy search.

   Parameters of an OceanBase cluster have three effective scopes: global, zone, and server, where global means the whole cluster. You can select the scope as needed when you modify the value.

   The default effective scope is **Cluster** . If you need to narrow the effective scope down to Zone or Server, clear **Cluster** in the Effective Scope section. Then, a list of zones under the cluster appears. Select a zone as prompted. If you select a zone and further select servers under the zone, the parameter takes effect only on the selected servers. 

   

   If you want different parameter values in different scopes, for example, you want the value of **backup_concurrency** to be **10** in **Zone 1** , **12** in **Zone 2** , and 20 on **Server 1** , you can click Add Value in the Value section. In the three record rows that appear, you can select the corresponding effective scope in each row. 
   **Note**

   

   If multiple rows of values are displayed after you click **Add Value** , sequentially modify the parameters from top down. For each successful modification, a record is generated on the **Change History** tab.
