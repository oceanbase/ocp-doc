Cluster overview
=====================================

Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. The **Cluster Overview** page automatically appears. To view the cluster overview data, the current logon user must have the management permission or read-only permission on clusters.

The **Cluster Overview** page displays the general information about clusters of the user, including **Top 5 Clusters by QPS**,**Top 5 Clusters by Elapsed Time of Major Freeze**,**Server Resources**,**Resource Usage**, and **Clusters**.

You can also take over and create a cluster. For more information, see [Take over a cluster](../../4.manage-clusters/3.basic-operations/1.takeover-cluster.md) and [Create a cluster](../../4.manage-clusters/3.basic-operations/2.create-a-cluster.md).

**Top 5 Clusters by QPS**
----------------------------------------------

This section displays top 5 clusters sorted by a specified performance metric in descending order in a specified time range. You can specify the performance metric and the time range as needed. You can click the More icon in the upper-right corner to enlarge the chart for a better view.

![TOP5](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/1714306461/p381781.png)

* The following performance metrics are available: **QPS (times/s), Query response time (us), Number of active sessions, and CPU Usage (percent)** .

  |       Metric        |                            Description                             |
  |---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | QPS (times/s)       | The queries per second of the cluster.                             |
  | Query response time | The average query response time of the cluster, in the unit of µs. |
  | Active sessions     | The total number of active sessions in the selected time range.    |
  | CPU Usage (percent) | The average CPU utilization of the cluster.                        |

* The following time ranges are available: **Last 1 Hour** , **Last 24 Hours** , and **Last 7 Days** .

**Top 5 Clusters by Elapsed Time of Major Freeze**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This section displays a bar chart of top 5 clusters with longest major compaction time in the last three days. A major compaction compacts all dynamic and static data, which is time-consuming. When the incremental data generated through minor compactions reaches the specified threshold, a major compaction of data is performed to obtain a major version.

This section is empty if no major compaction has been performed in the last three days. You can click the More icon in the upper-right corner to enlarge the chart for a better view.

**Server Resources**
-----------------------------------------

This section displays information about each IDC, including the name, total number of servers, and number of servers on which OBServer has been deployed. You can determine whether it is necessary to perform cluster scale-out based on such information.

**Resource Usage**
---------------------------------------

This section displays the resource usage information of each cluster, including the cluster name, number of tenants, allocated CPU resources in percentage, allocated memory in percentage, and occupied disk space. You can sort clusters by the allocated CPU resources, allocated memory, and disk usage. Also, you can click the name of a cluster to go to the cluster details page. For more information, see [Overview of the Cluster Details page](../1.cluster-features/3.cluster-overview.md).

**Clusters**
---------------------------------

This section displays the name, ID, version, deployment mode, status, creation time, and alert information of each cluster..

By default, for clusters deployed in primary/standby mode, only information about the primary cluster is displayed. You can click the ➕ icon on the left to view information about the standby cluster. You can click the name of a cluster to go to the cluster details page. For more information, see [Overview of the cluster details page](../1.cluster-features/3.cluster-overview.md).
