Tenant overview
====================================

A tenant is a logical concept that represents a resource allocation unit in OceanBase Database. It is the basis for the management of database objects and resources. It is critical for system O\&M, especially for the O\&M of cloud databases. After you log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console, click Tenants in the left-side navigation pane. The Tenant Overview page appears. By default, the page displays a list of tenants that you have the permission to view, and displays performance monitoring charts of top 5 tenants.

On the **Tenants** page, you can see a **Tenants** list and charts of **Top 5 Tenants** . You can also perform many tenant management operations on this page. For more information, see [Unit specification management](../../5.manage-tenants/2.basic-tenant-operations/3.unit-specification-management.md), [Create a tenant](../../5.manage-tenants/2.basic-tenant-operations/2.create-a-tenant-1.md), [Lock a tenant](../../5.manage-tenants/2.basic-tenant-operations/5.locked-tenants.md), and [Copy a tenant](../../5.manage-tenants/2.basic-tenant-operations/6.replication-tenant.md).

**Tenants**
--------------------------------

The **Tenants** list contains the following columns: **Tenant Name, Cluster, Replica Distribution, Primary Zone, Tenant Mode, Read-only, Locked, Status, Created At** , and **Actions** .

* You can click the name of a tenant to go to the tenant details page. For more information, see [Tenant summary](../2.tenant-functions/3.overview-of-tenant-details-page.md).

* You can click the cluster name to go to the Cluster Details page. For more information, see [Overview of the Cluster Details page](../1.cluster-features/3.cluster-overview.md).
