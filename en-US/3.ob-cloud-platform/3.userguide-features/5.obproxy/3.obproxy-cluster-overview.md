OBProxy cluster overview
=============================================

On the OBProxy Cluster Overview page, you can view the basic information of clusters, list of OBProxies, and accessible OceanBase clusters, and can add OBProxies, add accessible OceanBase clusters, upgrade all OBServers, change the password, download logs, restart all OBServers, and delete clusters.

View the basic information
-----------------------------------------------

On the OBProxy Cluster Overview page, you can view the cluster creator, deployment mode, and number of unrefreshed OBProxies, refresh the parameter version, edit the access URL, copy the value of ConfigUrl, and perform general OBProxy O\&M operations. For more information, see [Add an OBProxy](../../8.obproxy-management/6.add-obproxy.md), [Add accessible OceanBase clusters](../../8.obproxy-management/10.add-a-connectable-ob-cluster.md), [Upgrade an OBProxy](../../8.obproxy-management/5.upgrade-obproxy.md), [Restart an OBProxy](../../8.obproxy-management/4.restart-obproxy.md), [Refresh OBProxy configurations](../../8.obproxy-management/7.refresh-obproxy-configuration.md), [Download logs](../../4.manage-clusters/3.basic-operations/15.download-log.md), and [Delete a cluster](../../4.manage-clusters/3.basic-operations/3.delete-a-cluster.md).
