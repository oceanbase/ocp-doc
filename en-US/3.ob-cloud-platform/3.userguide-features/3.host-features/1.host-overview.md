Host overview
==================================

If you have the role of system administrator, host manager (HOST_MANAGER), or host read-only viewer (HOST_VIEWER), you can click **Hosts** in the left-side navigation pane go to the host overview page.

View hosts
-------------------------------

In the Hosts list, you can view the information of all current hosts in the following columns: **IP Address, SSH Port, Host Type, IDC, Cluster, Service, and Status** . You can also search for hosts by page, and by host IP address, host name, or cluster name.

You can also click the + icon in front of a host to view the detailed information about the host, including **Host ID, Host Name, Port Mapping, Host Type, OCP Agent Version, Operating System, Hardware Architecture** and **Description** .

| Cluster      | Indicates the cluster where the host resides, including the OceanBase cluster and the OBProxy cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Host Type    | Physical hosts and container hosts are supported. <li> You can deploy multiple services of different types on a physical host. Do not deploy multiple services of the same type on the same physical host; otherwise, conflicts may arise.  </li><li> You can deploy only one type of service on a container host. We recommend that you do not deploy an OceanBase cluster on a container host. </li>   |
| Status       | Valid values: Newly Submitted, Idle, Online, Offline, and Deleting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Port Mapping | Indicates the mapping relationship between ocp-agent and the host and between ocp export and the host in the following format: \<host port\>:\<ocp-agent port in docker\>, and \<host port\>:\<ocp-exporter port 1 in docker\>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
