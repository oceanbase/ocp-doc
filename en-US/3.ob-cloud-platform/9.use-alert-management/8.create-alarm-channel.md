Create an alert channel 
============================================

This topic describes how to create an alert channel. 

Background 
-------------------------------

Alerting is a standalone feature. If you do not configure alert channels or subscriptions, you can view alerts only on the **Alert Events** page of the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. To receive alert notifications, you must configure an alert channel and subscribe to an alert. 

The alert channel allows OCP to send notifications and supports the following channel types:

* HTTP
* Custom script: OCP supports Python and Bash scripts. For more information, see [Custom script channel](../12.appendix/9.alarm-channel-configuration-example.md).

  



> **Note**
>
> You can configure the time variables for alert aggregation when you configure a channel. After an alert channel is updated, the channel restarts alert aggregation. If an alert has not been cleared at that time, you may receive the alert notification again during the aggregation period.

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) provides a default alert channel. You need to configure it before use and you cannot delete it.

Prerequisites 
----------------------------------

* You have configured the basic information of the recipients.

  

* You have the administrator permissions.

  




Procedure 
------------------------------
