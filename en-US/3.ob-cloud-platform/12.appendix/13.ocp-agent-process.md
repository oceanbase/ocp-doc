| Process name  |                                    Function                                     |                                                         How to start and stop                                                         |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| pos_proxy     | Provides OCP-Server with the capability of running remote commands through RPC. | The process automatically starts after a host is added.                                                                               |
| node_exporter | A third-party component for collecting host hardware specifications.            | The process automatically starts after a host is added.                                                                               |
| ocp_agentd    | OCP-Agent deamon process.                                                       | The process automatically starts when the OCP-Agent process starts, and automatically stops when there is no process for it to guard. |
