Calculate the average execution frequency per minute (avg_exec_ps) of the SQL queries, the standard deviation of the execution frequency (std_exec_ps) in the last \$compareMin, and the ratio of the standard deviation to the average (range_percent).

We recommend that you leave this parameter unchanged.   |
| ocp.perf.sql.max-query-range  | 24h  | Specifies the maximum length of time range for querying SQL performance data. Default value: 24h.  If the time range of a query you specified on the **TopSQL** or **SlowSQL** tab exceeds the value of this parameter, an error is returned when you submit the query.  |
| ocp.perf.sql.plan-hist-level0-granularity  | 30s  | Specifies the time interval for OCP to aggregate the performance data of the Level 0 SQL execution plans, or plans for short.

You can increase this value to relieve the storage pressure for the MetaDB and MonitorDB of OCP.   |
| ocp.perf.sql.plan-hist-level0-query-interval  | 2h | Specifies the maximum time range for querying the Level 0 plan performance data.  If the specified query time range exceeds this value, OCP queries data tables with larger aggregation time intervals.  |
| ocp.perf.sql.plan-hist-level0-retention    | 5d  | Specifies the period for retaining performance data partitions of Level 0 plans.  Performance data partitions are created by day. By default, the data is retained for only five days. Partitions that have been retained for more than five days are automatically deleted.   |
| ocp.perf.sql.prepare-partition-ahead    | 8  | Specifies the number of days for creating performance data partitions before the diagnosis. You need to specify the period in days.   |
| ocp.perf.sql.query-timeout   | 30000000  | Specifies the timeout threshold for SQL performance data queries (μs).   |
| ocp.perf.sql.sql-hist-level0-granularity   | 30s  | Specifies the time interval for OCP to aggregate the performance data of the Level 0 SQL queries.  </br>**Note:**  To improve the performance of monitoring metric collection, OCP collects and aggregates SQL performance data at different time intervals for TopSQL diagnostics. The data is divided into three levels and is collected and stored in table partitions of the corresponding levels by day. The retention period for performance data partitions is specified by a fixed parameter.  For the same type of performance data, a larger time interval requires less storage space.  |
| ocp.perf.sql.sql-hist-level0-query-interval  | 2h | Specifies the maximum time range for querying the Level 0 SQL performance data.  If the time range you specified on the **TopSQL** tab exceeds this value, OCP queries the Level 1 SQL performance data tables.     |
| ocp.perf.sql.sql-hist-level0-retention     | 2d  | Specifies the retention period for partitions of Level 0 SQL performance data.  Partitions for Level 0 SQL performance data are created by day. By default, the MetaDB and MonitorDB of OCP only retains partitions created in the last two days.    |
| ocp.perf.sql.sql-hist-level1-granularity   | 2m  | Specifies the time interval for OCP to aggregate the performance data of the Level 1 SQL queries. By default, OCP aggregates SQL performance data once every 2 minutes and writes the data into Level 2 SQL performance data tables.     |
| ocp.perf.sql.sql-hist-level1-query-interval   | 12h  | Specifies the maximum time interval for querying the Level 1 SQL performance data.  If the time range you specified on the **TopSQL** tab exceeds this value, OCP queries the Level 2 SQL performance data tables.    |
| ocp.perf.sql.sql-hist-level1-retention    | 8d  | Specifies the retention period for partitions of Level 1 SQL performance data.     |
| ocp.perf.sql.sql-hist-level2-granularity   | 10m  | Specifies the time interval for OCP to aggregate the performance data of the Level 2 SQL queries. By default, OCP aggregates SQL performance data once every 10 minutes and writes the data into Level 2 SQL performance data tables.     |
| ocp.perf.sql.sql-hist-level2-query-interval   | 48h  | Specifies the maximum time interval for querying the Level 2 SQL performance data.  Regardless of whether the time range you specified exceeds this value, OCP queries the Level 2 SQL performance data tables.     |
| ocp.perf.sql.sql-hist-level2-retention   | 15d  | Specifies the retention period for partitions of Level 2 SQL performance data.     |
