FAQ 
------------------------

Q1: What is the difference between multi-zone mode and multi-cluster mode of OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP)? 

A: Multi-zone mode provides a mechanism to first constrain the data access or forwarding within the same IDC or city when OceanBase Database, OCP, or OBProxy is deployed across IDCs or cities. It effectively reduces the latency of data access and the cost of bandwidth across IDCs or cities.
Multi-cluster mode provides a cross-city high availability disaster recovery solution that better supports the deployment of primary and standby OceanBase clusters across cities.
