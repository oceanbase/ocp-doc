Create a user
==================================

This topic describes how to create a user.

Background
-------------------------------

We recommend that you use users with different permissions to manage OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) and assign each user the minimum necessary permissions. In this way, each user can only operate in their authorized scope, which prevents misoperations by non-professionals and information leakage, thereby ensuring information security.

The PROFILE role is the minimum permission set in OCP. A user with the PROFILE role can visit the personal center and modify the personal information and password box.

**Prerequisite**
-------------------------------------

You are logged on with an account that has the ADMIN or USER_MANAGER role.

**Procedure**
----------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console.



2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** **\>** **Security** .



3. Click **Create User** in the upper-right corner of the **User Management** tab.



4. Specify the following basic information of the user.
