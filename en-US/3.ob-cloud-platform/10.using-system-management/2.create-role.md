Create a role 
==================================

This topic describes how to create a role in OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP). 

Background 
-------------------------------

If you are a system administrator or role manager and the preset OCP roles cannot satisfy your needs, you can create custom roles and assign fine-grained permissions to them. You can use custom roles together with default ones to create diversified permission policies. 

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>Custom roles can only be granted permissions required for the management of clusters, tenants, and backup and recovery services and the permission to create clusters.</p>
  </main>

**Prerequisite** 
-------------------------------------

You are logged on with an account that has the ADMIN or ROLE_MANAGER role.

**Procedure** 
----------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** **\>** **Security** .

   

3. Click **Create Role** in the upper-right corner of the **Role Management** tab. 

   The **Create Role** page appears.
   

4. On the **Create Role** page, configure the **Basic Information** and the permissions. 

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>Management permissions, such as the create and edit permissions, do not implicate read-only permissions. When you assign management permissions to a role, you must also assign read-only permissions to it.</p>
  </main>
   1. In the **Basic Information** section, enter the following fields: **Role Name** and **Description** . 

      The role name must start with a letter and end with a letter or a digit. It can contain letters, digits, and underscores (_). It must be 2 to 32 characters in length.
      
   
   2. In the **Cluster Permissions** section, grant the **Read-only** , **Update** , **Delete** or **All Permissions** in one or more clusters to the role. 

      You can click **+ Add OceanBase Cluster Permission** to assign permissions to multiple clusters.
      
   
   3. In the **Tenant Permissions** section, grant the **Read-only** , **Update** , **Delete** , or **All Permissions** in one or more tenants to the role. 

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>To assign to a role read-only or management permissions in a tenant, you must also assign the role read-only or management permissions to the corresponding cluster.</p>
  </main>

      You can click **+ Add OceanBase Tenant Permission** to assign permissions to multiple tenants.
      
   
   4. In the **Backup and Recovery Permissions** section, you can grant permissions to back up and recover one or more clusters to the role. 

      Configure the permissions as prompted from the **Permissions** drop-down list. 

      You can click **+ Add Backup and Recovery Permission** to assign permissions to multiple clusters.
      
   
   5. In the **System Permissions** section, you can choose whether to grant the Create Cluster permission to the role.
