Take over an OBProxy
=========================================

This topic describes how to use the OBProxy cluster managed by the current OCP cluster to take over an OBProxy created by another OCP cluster. The OBProxy cluster that is created by another OCP cluster is called the to-be-taken-over OBProxy. The OBProxy cluster that is about to take over the to-be-taken-over OBProxy is called the target OBProxy cluster. After the candidate is taken over by the target, you can operate and maintain them both in the current OCP cluster.

Prerequisites
----------------------------------

* You have the OBPROXY_MANAGER role or permissions to manage OBProxy.



* The to-be-taken-over OBProxy cluster must meet the following conditions:

  * Its version is V1.8.0 or later.



  * It is installed by using the standard RPM package, and the installation path is `/opt/taobao/install/obproxy-{version}` .



  * The OBProxy host has only one obproxy process, and the process belongs to the administrator.



  * It is accessible in the network where the OCP cluster resides.



  * The OBProxy host has been added to the OCP cluster. For more information, see [Add a host](../6.management-host/2.add-host.md).






* The to-be-taken-over proxy and the target OBProxy cluster must match in the following aspects:

  * The startup method.

    For example, if the target OBProxy cluster starts in ConfigUrl mode, the to-be-taken-over OBProxy must also starts in ConfigUrl mode.


  * In ConfigUrl mode, the connectable OceanBase clusters of the to-be-taken-over OBProxy cluster are among those for the target OBProxy cluster.



  * In RsList mode, the to-be-taken-over OBProxy and the target OBProxy cluster must share exactly the same connectable OceanBase clusters.









Procedure
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console.



2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy** to go to the OBProxy page.



3. Go to the **Take over OBProxy** page.

   * Path 1: In the **Clusters** list, find an eligible target cluster that can take the to-be-taken-over OBProxy, and then click **Take over OBProxy** in the Actions column.

   * Path 2:

     1. In the **Clusters** list, find an eligible target cluster that can take over the to-be-taken-over OBProxy, and then click the cluster name to go to the **Overview** page of the target OBProxy cluster.



     2. Click **Take over OBProxy** in the upper-right corner of the **Overview** page.

4. In the **Take over OBProxy** page that appears, select the host where the to-be-taken-over OBProxy is deployed.

5. Click **Next** . The system checks the to-be-taken-over OBProxies and displays the result on the pre-check page.

   If the check fails, the takeover cannot proceed. In this case, perform the following steps:
   * Remove the OBProxy that fails the check based on the actual situation and take over only the OBProxy that passes the pre-check.



   * Move the pointer over the cause icon in the **I** **nspection results** column to view the cause of the check failure.

     After you fix the problem, click **Recheck** .





   When all OBProxies in the list pass the pre-check, proceed to Step 6.

6. Click **Take over All** .

   Wait for the takeover task to complete.
