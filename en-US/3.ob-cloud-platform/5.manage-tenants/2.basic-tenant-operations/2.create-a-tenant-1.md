Create a tenant
====================================

A tenant is a container for various database objects and resources (such as CPU, memory, and I/O). You can create tenants in a cluster as needed.

You can create tenants in one of the following two ways:

* Create a tenant on the Tenant Overview page.



* Create a tenant on the Tenant Management page of the specified cluster.






This topic describes how to create a tenant on the Tenant Management page of the specified cluster.

Prerequisites
----------------------------------

* The cluster where you want to create the tenant is the running primary cluster.



* The logged-on user has the permission to manage the cluster, for example, the user is the system administrator or OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) tenant administrator.






Procedure
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console.



2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** .



3. In the **Clusters** list , find the target cluster and click its name.



4. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Tenant Management** .



5. In the upper-right corner of the page that appears, click **Create Tenant** .

6. Specify the **Basic Information** .

   1. The default cluster is the current cluster.



   2. Fill in the **Tenant Name** . The tenant name must be 2 to 64 characters in length and can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and underscores (_).






7. Fill in the **Zone Information** .

   1. Configure the replica type, unit specification, and unit quantity for z1, z2, and z3.

      After you select a cluster, the page provides a list of supported zones based on the zone information of the selected cluster. You can select zones for which replica locality does not need to be specified and click the Delete button on the right to delete them.
      * Select a replica type from the drop-down list. Full-featured, read-only, and log replicas are supported.



      * You can use the built-in unit specifications or click Add Specification at the bottom of the drop-down list to add a custom specification.



      * Specify the number of units in the zone. Note that the number of units cannot exceed the number of servers in the zone. ![1](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9204306461/p399410.png)






   2. Configure the zone priorities. If you drag multiple zones to the right at a time, these zones have the same priority.![1](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9204306461/p399411.png)






8. Complete the **Basic Settings** .

   1. Set the **Administrator Password** . The password can be generated randomly.

      * In MySQL mode, the administrator account is "root".



      * In Oracle mode, the administrator account is "SYS". The password must be 8 to 32 characters in length and contain at least two digits, two uppercase letters, two lowercase letters, and two special characters. The following special characters are supported . _ + @ # $ %






   2. Set **Tenant Mode** .

      * The Oracle and MySQL tenant modes are available.



      * The Oracle mode is supported only for OceanBase Database V2.1 and later.






   3. Set **Character Set** .

      * In MySQL mode, the supported character sets are utf8mb4, binary, gbk, and gb18030. Default value: utf8mb4.



      * In Oracle mode, the supported character sets are utf8mb4, gbk, and gb18030. Default value: utf8mb4.






   4. Optional. Set the **Remarks** .



   5. Set the **IP Address Whitelist** .

      * You can specify a list of clients that are allowed to log on to this tenant. Default value: %, indicating that all client connections are allowed. When you configure the whitelist, you must add the IP addresses of the OCP server and the OBProxy server to it. Otherwise, you cannot manage the tenant from OCP.

        * Default: All IP addresses are allowed.



        * Custom configuration: You can set an IP address whitelist to allow access from IP addresses in the whitelist.






      * Configure the whitelist in the following formats:

        * IP address example: 10.10.10.10,10.10.10.11



        * Subnet/mask example: 10.10.10.0/24



        * Fuzzy match example: 10.10.10.% or 10.10.10._



        * Mixed format example: 10.10.10.10, 10.10.10.11, 10.10.10.%, 10.10.10._, 10.10.10.0/24
