Add a host 
===============================

This topic describes how to add a host to OCP to add your offline resources to the OCP console. 

**Prerequisite** 
-------------------------------------

You are logged on with an account that has the host management permissions.

**Procedure** 
----------------------------------

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Hosts** .

   

3. In the upper-right corner of the page, click **Add Host** .

4. Enter the IP address and SSH port number. Enter the IPv4 address of the new host. The SSH port number is 22 by default.

   

5. Select the host type. If the list does not include the corresponding host type, click Create Host Type to create a host type on OCP. 

   A host type is a label that you specify for hosts with the same configurations. We recommend that you specify a meaningful host type to facilitate host management.

6. Select the IDC. If the list does not include the corresponding IDC, you can click Create IDC to create an IDC on OCP. 

   * The region means the geographical region where the host is located. One physical region can have one or more physical IDCs.

     
   
   * The region and IDC are referenced in OceanBase load balancing and SQL statement routing policies. Specify the actual region and IDC.

     
   

   
   > **Note**
   >
   > OCP V3.1.1 and later support multi-zone mode. When you add an IDC, it is created in the zone where the current OCP is deployed.
