</main>

## Check the file system type

The file system type can be EXT4 or XFS. If the disk capacity is greater than 16 TB, the system checks whether the file system is of the XFS type. If the file system is not of the XFS type, we recommend that you reconfigure the disks.

## Check kernel parameters

The system checks whether the kernel parameters of the host meet the requirements.

| Kernel parameter | Default value range | Description  |
 |--- |------------| --- |
| net.core.somaxconn | 2048 ≤ value ≤ 16384 | The maximum length of the port listening queue. This is a global parameter.    |
| net.core.netdev_max_backlog | 500 ≤ value ≤ 10000 | The maximum number of packets that can be sent to a queue when a network interface receives packets faster than the kernel processes them.    |

The default values of `min`, `default`, and `max` are respectively `4096`, `65536`, and `16777216`. <br>The first value specifies the minimum size of the socket send buffer in bytes.<br>The second value specifies the default size of the socket send buffer. The size of the socket send buffer can increase to this value if the system is not heavily loaded. This value will be overridden by `wmem_default`. <br>The third value specifies the maximum size of the socket send buffer in bytes. This value will be overridden by `wmem_max`.          |
| net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog | 1024 ≤ value ≤ 16384 | The maximum number of connections in the queue waiting for the peer to confirm. If the server is frequently overloaded, you may increase the value of this parameter. Default value: `1024`.    |
| net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout | 15 ≤ value ≤ 60 | The duration of the FIN-WAIT-2 state before the socket connection is aborted at the local end. The peer may disconnect or never end the connection, or the process may terminate unexpectedly.     |

| vm.zone_reclaim_mode | ==0 | The value `0` specifies to disable the zone reclaim mode, so that memory can be reclaimed from other zones or NUMA nodes to avoid performance jitters caused by reclaim.        |
| fs.file-max | ≥ 6573688 | The maximum number of files that can be opened in the entire system. This parameter specifies a system-level limit to avoid an excessive small default value.       |
| fs.pipe-user-pages-soft | == 0 | The soft limit on the total size, in pages, of all pipes created or set by a single non-privileged user, for example, a user with neither the `CAP_SYS_RESOURCE` nor `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability. We recommend that you set this value to `0`, which indicates not to apply the soft limit.      |

**Manually modify the settings:** Taking the `net.core.somaxconn` parameter as an example, write `net.core.somaxconn = 128` to the `/etc/sysctl.d/oceanbase.conf` configuration file in echo mode. To delete a parameter, delete the corresponding line from the file.

## Check services

Check the `crond`, `sshd` and `firewalld` services. Check whether the `crond` and `sshd` services are enabled, and whether the `firewalld` service is disabled.

| Service | Description |
| --- | --- |
| crond | A service that is used to set scheduled tasks and provide related O&M capabilities. We recommend that you enable it.  |
| sshd | A service that is used for encrypted logon or data transmission and provides basic O&M capabilities. We recommend that you enable it.  |
| firewalld | We recommend that you disable the `firewalld` service or add allow rules for each service in the OceanBase Database cluster to avoid being blocked by the firewall.  |

**Manually modify the settings:**

* Enable a service: `systemctl enable {serviceName} && systemctl start {serviceName}`
* Disable a service: `systemctl stop {serviceName} && systemctl disable {serviceName}`

## Check settings for the transparent huge page feature

Disable the transparent huge page feature to enhance system performance stability.

**Manually modify the settings:** Run the `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` command to set the status of the transparent huge page feature to `never`. We recommend that you add this command to the `rc.local` or `systemd` configuration to persist the configuration.

## Check the python version

OceanBase-related scripts depend on Python 2.7.x. You must check the Python version to ensure that the related scripts can run properly.

**Manually modify the settings:** Install Python 2.7 by using the software package management tool. Make sure that the version returned by the `python -V` command is 2.7.

## Check whether swap partitions are enabled

Check whether swap partitions are enabled on the server. We recommend that you disable swap partitions to avoid performance jitter.

**Manually modify the settings:** Run `swapoff/swapon -a` and delete swap-related entries in `/etc/fstab`, which is used to store configurations.

## Check for related commands

Ensure that the toolkits that are used to run and maintain OceanBase Database and OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) exist.

| RPM package | Corresponding commands | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| net-tools | `netstat`, `arp`, `ether-wake`, `ifconfig`, `ipmaddr`, `iptunnel`, `mii-diag`, `mii-tool`, `nameif`, `plipconfig`, `route`, and `slattach` | Network-related command packages, which are required in O&M. We recommend that you install all these command packages.  |

**Manually modify the settings:** Ensure that the network is connected and that the relevant software sources are configured. Then, run commands such as `yum/apt-get/zypper install` to install the software packages.

## Check for so files

Check whether the following so files exist:

| RPM package | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Libaio | A dependency package for programs. |
| libatomic | A dependency package for programs. |

**Manually modify the settings:** Ensure that the network is connected and that the relevant software sources are configured. Then, run commands such as `yum/apt-get/zypper install` to install the software packages.

## Check for the admin user

Check whether services related to OCP or OceanBase Database are running with the permissions of the admin user.

**Manually modify the settings:** Set users with `uid=500` and `gid=500` as admin users by using the `useradd` and `groupadd` commands.

## Check whether SELinux is enabled

Check whether SELinux is enabled in the system. SELinux uses Mandatory Access Control (MAC) to control permissions for specific programs and file resources. We recommend that you disable SELinux.

**Manually modify the settings:** Run the `/usr/sbin/setenforce 0` command to disable SELinux and change the value of `SELINUX` in `/etc/selinux/config` to `disabled`.

## Check the OS version
The following table describes the requirements on OS versions.
| Linux OS |     Version   | Server architecture  |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| Alibaba Cloud Linux        | 7.2 or later | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (Kunpeng and Phytium) |

|  Debian        | 8.3 or later | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (Kunpeng and Phytium) |

**Manually modify the settings:** Update the system to the required version. 

## Check the system limit information returned by the `ulimit` command

Check the system limit information to determine the resources occupied by shell startup processes. The observer process involves several limits, including the maximum stack size (`stack`) of a thread, the maximum number of file handles (`open files`), and the core file size (`core file size`). To avoid the impact of system restrictions on services, we recommend that you set the ulimit-related parameters as follows:

```Json
root soft nofile 655350
root hard nofile 655350
admin soft nofile 655350
admin hard nofile 655350
admin soft stack 20480
admin hard stack 20480
admin soft nproc 655360
admin hard nproc 655360
admin soft core unlimited
admin hard core unlimited
```

**Manually modify the settings:** Create the `/etc/security/limits.d/99-oceanbase_limits.conf` file and write the preceding configurations to the file. Make sure that the file has the top priority.
