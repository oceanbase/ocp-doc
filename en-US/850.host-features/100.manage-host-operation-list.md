# Host management operations

If you are assigned with the role of system administrator, host manager (HOST_MANAGER), or host read-only viewer (HOST_VIEWER), you can click **Hosts** in the left-side navigation pane go to the **Hosts** page.

## View hosts

The **Hosts** list displays the information of each host in columns such as **IP Address**, **SSH Port**, **Host Category**, **IDC**, **Cluster**, **Service**, and **Status**.

* You can also search for hosts by page, and by host IP address, host name, or cluster name. You can search for multiple hosts at a time by specifying their IP addresses separated with spaces.
* You can filter hosts by using the **Host Category**, **IDC**, **Service**, and **Status** columns.
* When a host is in the **Maintaining** state, you can click **View Task** in the **Actions** column to go to the task details page of the cluster. On the task details page, you can perform operations such as viewing task logs, rolling back a task, and retrying a task. For more information, see [Manage tasks](../1600.system-management-features/100.manage-tasks.md).
* You can click the name of a cluster to go to the **Overview** page of the cluster and view its details.
