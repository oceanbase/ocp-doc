# Edit a tenant replica in a zone

This topic describes how to edit a tenant replica in a zone.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants**. The **Tenant Overview** page appears.

3. In the **Tenants** list, find the target tenant and click its name. The **Tenant Details** page appears.

4. In the **Replica Details** section, you can perform different operations based on the version of the OceanBase cluster.

   * If the version of the cluster is earlier than V4.0, you can click **Edit** in the **Actions** column of a zone to modify the replica type, unit specification, and number of units of the zone.

   * If the version of the cluster is V4.0 and later, you cannot separately modify the number of units of each zone. You can click **Modify Unit** in the upper-right corner to collectively modify the number and specifications of units of all zones under the tenant.
      You can also click **Edit** in the **Actions** column of a zone to modify the replica type and unit specifications of the zone.
