# View the topology of a tenant

Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants**. On the **Tenants** page, find the target tenant and click its name. The **Overview** page of the tenant automatically appears. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Topology** to view the topology of the tenant.

This topic shows the distribution of tenant replicas in the cluster. In the upper-right corner of the page, you can resize and refresh the topology.

The topology consists of three layers:

* The first layer, which indicates the cluster.

* The second layer, which indicates the zones.

* The third layer, which indicates the OBServers.

      > **Note**
      >
      > If the version of the OceanBase Database is V4.0 and later, you can only set the same number of units for all zones. <ul><li>When you create the first replica of a tenant, the number of units that you specify in this dialog box applies to all zones under this tenant. </li><li>If the tenant already has a replica, you can no longer set the number of units for the new replica. By default, the number of units for the new replica is the same as that for the first created replica.

If a server hosts a resource unit of a tenant, the server icon is displayed in green. Otherwise, the server icon is gray.
