# OCP configuration parameters

This topic lists all system parameters in OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) for reference by OCP admins. After a parameter is modified, the modification takes effect in about ten minutes. Some parameters only take effect after OCP Server restarts. The need for restart is indicated in the description column of the tables.

## Global configuration

|**Parameter**            |   **Default value** | **Description**  |
|-------|---|---|
| ocp.version  | 2.5.0 | The version of OCP.  |

| ocp.env                            | private               | The OCP environment.  |
| ocp.site.url                       | `http://localhost:8080` | The URL for accessing the OCP site. The URL must start with HTTP. HTTPS is not supported. It must contain the virtual IP (VIP) address, domain name, and port number, and not end with a forward slash (/). Example: `http://localhost:8080`                         |
| ocp.config-url.site.url            |   | The URL for accessing the OCP config url service. The default value is empty, indicating that the URL specified for the ocp.site.url parameter is used. If the config url service is deployed separately, you must set a value different from that of ocp.site.url. |
| ocp.config-url.use-request-address | TRUE                  | The URL for the requests used by responses in the config url service. The default value is TRUE. If it is set to FALSE, responses will use the URL specified for the ocp.config-url.site.url parameter.   |

The data is divided into three levels and is collected and stored in table partitions of the corresponding levels by day. The retention period for performance data partitions is specified by a fixed parameter.  For the same type of performance data, a larger time interval requires less storage space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
