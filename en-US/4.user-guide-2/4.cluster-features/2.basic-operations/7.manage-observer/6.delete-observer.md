Delete an OBServer
================================

This topic describes how to delete an OBServer. When you delete an OBServer, the resource unit on the OBServer is automatically migrated to another OBServer in the same zone. If the resources available for the OBServers in the same zone are insufficient, the migration will fail and the resource unit is irreversibly deleted along with the OBServer. Proceed with caution.

Prerequisites
-------------------------

* You have the permission to delete the cluster.

* Your OceanBase cluster is managed in the current OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) cluster.

   Otherwise, you need to use the current OCP cluster to take over your OceanBase cluster. For more information, see [Take over a cluster](../1.take-over-a-cluster.md).

Procedure
-------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

   The **Cluster Overview** page automatically appears.

2. In the **Clusters** list on this page, find the target cluster and click its name to go to the **Overview** page of the cluster.

3. In the **OBServers** list, find the row that contains the target OBServer, and click **Delete** in the **Actions** column.

4. In the dialog box that appears, click **Delete**.

   In the dialog box, you can click **View Task** to view the progress of the deletion task.

   You can also choose **System Management > Tasks** to view the progress of the task.

   When the task status is **Completed**, and the **OBServers** list on the **Overview** page of the cluster does not contain the OBServer, the OBServer is deleted.
