# Take over a cluster

You can take over a cluster that is created on a command-line client or another OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) system, and maintain and manage the cluster through the current OCP system.

## Prerequisite

The logon user who takes over the cluster has the CLUSTER_MANAGER role, or the permission to create a cluster.

## Procedure

1. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** . The Cluster Overview page appears.

2. Click **Take over Cluster** in the upper-right corner.

3. Connect to the cluster. The following two connection modes are supported: :

   1. Direct Connection: Specify **URL** , **Port** , and **Root@sys Password** , and click **Next** .![1](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/4125306461/p393995.png)

   2. **OBProxy** : Specify **URL** , **Port** , **Cluster Name** , **Cluster ID (Optional)** , and **Root@sys Password** , and click **Next** .

      > **Note**
      >
      > When you are taking over a standby cluster, you must specify the cluster ID. If you need to take over both the primary and standby clusters, take over the primary cluster first.

4. After the cluster is connected, perform pre-takeover check.

   * When the check succeeds, select the host, type, and credentials, and click **Import** in the lower-right corner of the page.

   * If the check fails, move the pointer over the icon next to Failed, modify the OBServer configuration as prompted, and then click **Recheck** **.**
