# Overview of cluster tenant management

You can view the tenants, the resource distribution information of all tenants, and monitoring data of top 5 tenants in the cluster that you manage.

## Prerequisites

You have all permissions on the cluster and the management permissions on its tenants.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

   The **Cluster Overview** page automatically appears.

2. In the **Clusters** list, find the target cluster and click its name.

3. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Tenant Management** .

4. You can view the resource distribution on the **Tenant Management** page.

   The resource distribution information includes the CPU utilization, memory usage, and disk usage of each tenant in percentage, as well as the remaining CPU, memory, and disk resources of the system in percentage.

   1. When you move the pointer over a tenant in the pie chart, the chart displays the specific resource usage of the tenant.

   2. Click **Create Tenant** to create a tenant for the cluster. For more information, see [Create a tenant](../5.tenant-functions/2.manage-basic-tenant-operations/1.create-a-tenant-3.md).

5. The **Tenants** list displays the basic information of all tenants and contains the following columns: Tenant Name, Replica Distribution, Zone Priority, Tenant Mode, Read-only, Locked, Status, Created On, and Actions.![16](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/8730818461/p200733.png)

6. In the **Top 5 Tenants** section, you can view the performance metrics of the top 5 tenants by workload, such as the QPS, TPS, SQL response time, transaction response time, sessions, event waiting_count, event waiting_time, capacity_tables, and capacity_partitions. You can also view the monitoring information of the last hour, day, or week as needed. ![18](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/8730818461/p200735.png)The following table describes the performance monitoring metrics.
