# Password box

You can create and manage connection credentials in the password box of your User Center. 

## Create a connection

Before you migrate the password box, you must create a connection between the original and the new OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) clusters. For more information, see [Create a connection](../../12.management-user-center/1.create-connection.md). 

## Import a connection

When you take over a cluster, you can export connection credentials from the old OCP cluster and import them to the new OCP cluster. This way, the whole password box is migrated. For more information, see [Import connection credentials](../../12.management-user-center/3.import-connection.md). 

## Accept a connection

Other OCP users can share connection credentials with you. However, you can accept or ignore these connections. For more information, see [Accept a connection](../../12.management-user-center/8.accept-connection.md) and [Ignore a connection](../../12.management-user-center/9.ignore-connection.md). 

## OceanBase cluster

On the **OceanBase Cluster** tab, you can view the connection information of the OceanBase cluster in the following columns: **Connected Object**, **Destination Type**, **Username**, **Password**, and **Description**. You can also manage the connection credentials of an OceanBase cluster. For more information, see [Share connection credentials](../../12.management-user-center/4.share-connection.md), [Edit connection credentials](../../12.management-user-center/5.edit-connection.md), [Export connection credentials](../../12.management-user-center/2.export-connection.md), [Delete connection credentials](../../12.management-user-center/6.del-connection.md), and [Batch operations on connection credentials](../../12.management-user-center/7.operation-connection.md). 

You can filter the destination type by **OceanBase Cluster** and **OceanBase Tenant**.
