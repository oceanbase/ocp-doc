# os_observer_not_exist

## Description

This alert is triggered when the observer process on an OBServer does not exist. 

## Principle

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Metric | observer_process_exists |
| Source | This metric is a basic host monitoring metric. To check whether any observer process exists, you can run `ps -ef|grep -w observer|grep -v grep|wc -l` to return the number of observer processes in the system.  |
| Collected metric | process_exists |
| Metric expression | min(process_exists{name="observer",@LABELS}) by (@GBLABELS) |
| Collection cycle | 1 second |

## Alert rule

| Metric expression | Metric description | Default threshold | Detection cycle | Elimination cycle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| observer_process_exists == 0 | <li>0: The process does not exist.</li><li>1: The process exists.</li> | 0 | 10 seconds | 5 minutes |

## Alert information

| Trigger method | Alert level | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Based on the expression of the metric | Critical | Server |

## Alert templates

* Overview
   * Template: \${alarm_target} ${alarm_name}
   * Example: ob_cluster=obcluster-1631964370:svr_ip=192.168.0.1 os_observer_not_exist
* Details
   * Template: Cluster: \${ob_cluster_name}, host: ${svr_ip}, alert: os_observer_not_exist. 
   * Example: Cluster: obcluster, host: 192.168.0.1, alert: os_observer_not_exist. 

## Impact on the system

* For a single-replica system, system services will be unavailable if the observer process does not exist. 
* For a multi-replica OceanBase cluster, the availability of the cluster may decrease if the observer process on an OBServer does not exist. For example, the number of zones changes from 3 to 2, or the number of Internet Data Centers (IDCs) in the same region changes from 3 to 2. 

## Possible causes

The faulty OBServer is restarted accidentally. For example, the observer process is killed when the system resources are insufficient. 

## Suggested solutions

1. Check whether the basic monitoring metrics of the host, such as the memory usage, CPU utilization, load, and disk usage, are as expected. 
2. Check whether a large number of ERROR logs exist in the run logs of the OBServer.

   ```yaml
   tail -10000 /home/admin/oceanbase/log/observer.log.wf | grep ERROR | wc -l
   ```

   If yes, contact Technical Support. 

3. Check the OS logs. Search for the keyword "error" in the `/var/log/messages` log file and check the returned information.
