# host_agent_open_fd_count_over_threshold

## Description

This alert is triggered when the number of file handles of an Agent process exceeds the threshold.

The Agent service consists of the monitoring Agent process ocp_monagent and the O\&M Agent process ocp_mgragent. It is an important tool for managing and monitoring OceanBase databases in OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP).

## Alert templates

* Overview: \${alarm_target} ${alarm_name}

* Details:
  Server: Cluster: ${ob_cluster_name}, Host: ${host}, Alert: Agent process: \${process}. The number of file handles is \${value}, exceeding the threshold of ${alarm_threshold}.
  
* Overview example:
  svr_ip=192.168.0.1:process=ocp_monagent Excessive number of Agent file handles on the server

* Details example:

  Server: Cluster: obcluster-1, Host: 192.168.0.1, Alert: Agent process: ocp_monagent. The number of file handles is 1200, exceeding the threshold of 1000.
  
## Impact on the system

Agent processes are important tools for OceanBase database O\&M and monitoring in OCP. It is crucial to keep Agent processes stable. The number of file handles is an important metric to evaluate the stability of a process. An increasing number of file handles indicates that the system may encounter handle leakage.

## Possible causes

1. The Agent process for monitoring may not release resources promptly after completing operations such as read and write of databases, logs, and configuration files in a collection task.

2. Resource errors may occur when the O\&M Agent process handles or tracks the logs of OceanBase databases.

## Suggested solutions

When the alert is triggered, view the alert details to check the memory or file handles used by the Agent process.

* If more than 10 GB of memory or more than 65,535 file handles are used, restart the Agent process immediately to avoid impact on OceanBase database running.

* If the Agent process uses an acceptable amount of memory, such as memory within 2 GB, which does not affect OceanBase database running, you can perform the following operations:

  1. Save the environment context and then restart the Agent process immediately.

  2. Send the following context information to the O\&M engineer:

     * The memory used by the Agent process and its parent process ocp_agentd.

     * The memory performance analysis file for the Agent process.
