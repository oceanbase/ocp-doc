**Examples**
---------------------------------

**Sample request**

Query the performance trend of the plan with a UID of AAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAJ_AAFszE_cnfR based on the cluster ID 1 and tenant ID 1001, and set the time range to 2020-11-03T19:00:00+08:00 to 2020-11-03T20:00.

```code
/api/v2/ob/clusters/1/tenants/1001/plans/AAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAJ_AAFszE_cnfR/trends?startTime=2020-11-03T19%3A00%3A00%2B08%3A00&endTime=2020-11-03T20%3A00%3A00%2B08%3A00
