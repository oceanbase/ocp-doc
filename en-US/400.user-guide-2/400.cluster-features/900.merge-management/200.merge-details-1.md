# Details of major compaction

A major compaction merges all dynamic and static data, which is time-consuming. When the incremental data generated in minor compactions reaches the specified threshold, OceanBase Database performs a major compaction on data of the same major version.
You can view the overall major compaction status of the cluster on the Details of Major Compaction tab. When an exception occurs in a tenant during the major compaction, you can view the exception information. For more information, see [Details of tenant major compaction](../../500.tenant-functions/1100.merge-management/200.merge-details.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

   The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

2. In the **Clusters** list, find the target cluster and click its name.

3. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Compaction Management**.

4. On the **Details of Major Compaction** tab, view the basic information about the major compaction.

   The **Basic Information** section displays the cluster status, and the start and end time of the last major compaction.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>For an ongoing major compaction, the <strong>Start Time of Last Major Compaction</strong> field shows the start time of the major compaction. After the major compaction is completed, the <strong>End Time of Last Major Compaction</strong> field automatically displays the end time of the major compaction.</p>
  </main>

5. View the major compaction progress of the cluster.

   The **Major Compaction Progress** section shows the information about the last major compaction of tenants in the cluster. If a major compaction is in progress, the information about the ongoing major compaction is displayed. If no major compaction is in progress, the details of the last major compaction are displayed.
   * The progress bars show the following three major compaction states of all tenants: **Error**, **In Major Compaction**, and **Completed**.
   * You can hover the pointer over the time consumed in a progress bar to view the start time, end time, time consumed, and status of the major compaction.

6. View the MemStore consumption of tenants.

   You can perform the following operations to view and analyze the MemStore consumption data in the trend chart:

   * To view the trend details over a specific period of time, drag the pointer over the period of time to select this period. The system will then zoom in to display the trend details. After you view the trend details, double-click the trend chart to return to normal.
   * To hide the data of a tenant, click the icon of the tenant. The icon of the tenant will then turn gray and the data of the tenant will be hidden from the chart. You can also click the ![p168813](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/%E5%8F%8D%E9%80%89.png) icon on the right side of a tenant to hide the information of other tenants.
   * To view data at a specific point in time, hover the pointer over this point in time on the trend chart.
   * You can select tenants for display. By default, the five tenants that consume the most MemStore memory are displayed. To display tenants as needed, click **Select Tenant** in the upper-right corner of the trend chart and select the tenants that you want to display. The chart displays at most 10 tenants at the same time.

7. View the resource consumption of the cluster.

   You can perform the following operations to view and analyze the cluster resource consumption data in the trend chart:

   * To view the trend details over a specific period of time, drag the pointer over the period of time to select this period. The system will then zoom in to display the trend details. After you view the trend details, double-click the trend chart to return to normal.
   * To hide the data of a tenant, click the icon of the tenant. The icon of the tenant will then turn gray and the data of the tenant will be hidden from the chart.
   * To view data at a specific point in time, hover the pointer over this point in time on the trend chart.
