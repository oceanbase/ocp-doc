# OBProxy overview

OBProxy can forward user-initiated data access requests to the corresponding OBServer. OBProxy allows you to create an OBProxy cluster, view the OBProxy cluster information, and view the OBProxy monitoring information.

## Clusters

The Clusters list contains the following columns: **OBProxy Cluster Name**, **Deployment Mode**, **Connectable OceanBase Clusters**, **Access URL**, **Port**, **Version**, **Created At** , and **Actions** . The Actions column provides the **Add OBProxy** and **Delete** options. Click a cluster name in the **OBProxy Cluster Name** column. The details page of the corresponding cluster appears. For more information, see [Create an OBProxy cluster](../../800.obproxy/100.create-an-obproxy-cluster-2.md), [Add an OBProxy](../../800.obproxy/600.add-obproxy.md), [Delete an OBProxy cluster](../../800.obproxy/1100.delete-obproxy-cluster-1.md).

## Top 5 Monitoring Metrics

In the **Top 5 Monitoring Metrics** section, you can view statistics such as **TPS**, **QPS**, **Client Connections**, **Server Connections**, **SQL Response Time**, **Routing Tables** , and **Net bytes** . You can click **Last Hour, Last 24 Hours** , and **Last 7 Days** in the drop-down list to view data of the corresponding time range.
