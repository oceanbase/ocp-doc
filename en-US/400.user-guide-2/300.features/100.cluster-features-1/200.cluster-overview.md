## Top 5 Clusters by Elapsed Time of Major Compaction

This section displays a bar chart of top 5 clusters with the longest major compaction time in the last three days. A major compaction merges all dynamic and static data, which is time-consuming. When the incremental data generated through minor compactions reaches the specified threshold, a major compaction of data is performed to obtain a major version.

This section is empty if no major compaction has been performed in the last three days. You can click the zoom-in icon in the upper-right corner to zoom in the chart for a better view.
