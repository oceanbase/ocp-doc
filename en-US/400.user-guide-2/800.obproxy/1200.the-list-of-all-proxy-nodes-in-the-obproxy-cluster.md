# Upgrade an OBProxy cluster

This topic describes how to upgrade all OBProxies of an OBProxy cluster in OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), even the upgraded OBProxy cluster contains OBProxies with different CPU architectures.

When you upgrade an OBProxy cluster, all OBProxies in the cluster are upgraded. Therefore, the service of the OBProxy cluster is suspended. If the current OBProxy cluster is providing services, we recommend that you upgrade OBProxies in the cluster in batches based on your load-balancing strategy. For more information, see [Upgrade OBProxy](../800.obproxy/500.upgrade-obproxy.md).

## Prerequisites

You are logged on to the OCP console and are assigned the OBPROXY_MANAGER role.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the OBProxy cluster list, click the OBProxy cluster that you want to delete. Then, the **Overview** page of the OBProxy cluster appears.

4. Click **Upgrade All**.

    <ul>
    <li>You can select only a version that is later than the current highest version.</li>
    <li>When you upgrade an OBProxy cluster that contains OBProxies with different CPU architectures, if the selected installation package version is unavailable in any of those CPU architectures, the upgrade will fail.</li>
    </ul>
  </main>

6. Click **OK**.

   In the dialog box that appears, you can click **View Task** to view the upgrade progress.

   When the task status is **Completed**, and the status of the OBProxies is **Running** in the **OBProxies** list on the **Overview** page, the OBProxy cluster is upgraded.
