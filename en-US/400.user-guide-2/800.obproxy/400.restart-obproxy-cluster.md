Restart an OBProxy 
=======================================

This topic describes how to restart an OBProxy. The OBProxy will stop working during the restart. If you have configured Server Load Balancer (SLB) instances for the OBProxy cluster, and other functional OBProxies are available in the cluster, business requests can be forwarded to the functional OBProxies by SLB instances. This avoids business interruptions due to the OBProxy restart. 

Prerequisites 
----------------------------------

The logged-on user in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console uses the OBPROXY_MANAGER role.

Procedure 
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy** .

   

3. In the OBProxy cluster list, click the target OBProxy cluster to go to the **Overview** page of that OBProxy cluster.

   

4. Find the OBProxy to restart in the OBProxies list, click **Restart** in the **Actions** column. ![1](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/8704306461/p399671.png)

   You can also select multiple OBProxies, and click **Batch Restart** . ![1](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/8704306461/p399670.png)

   To restart all OBProxies in the OBProxy cluster, you can directly restart the cluster. For more information, see [Restart an OBProxy cluster](../800.obproxy/1300.restarts-all-obproxy-nodes-in-the-obproxy-cluster.md).
   

5. In the dialog box that appears, click **Restart** . 

   In the dialog box, you can click **View Task** to view the progress of restart. 

   When the task status is **Completed** , and the status of the OBProxy is **Running** in the **OBProxies** list on the **Overview** page, the OBProxy is restarted.
