Create a user
==================================

This topic describes how to create a user.

Background
-------------------------------

We recommend that you use users with different permissions to manage OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) and assign each user the minimum necessary permissions. In this way, each user can only operate in their authorized scope. This prevents misoperations by non-professionals and information leakage, and therefore ensures information security.

The minimum permission in OCP is the PROFILE role. A user with this role can visit the user center and modify their personal information and password box.

**Prerequisites**
--------------------------------------

The logged-on user has the ADMIN or USER_MANAGER role.

**Procedure**
----------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management \> Security** .

3. Click **Create User** in the upper-right corner of the **User Management** tab.

4. Specify the following basic information of the user.

   |   Parameter   |  Description   |
   |---------------|--------------|
   | Username      | Required.  The username must be 4 to 48 characters in length and start with a lowercase letter. The username can contain lowercase letters, digits, underscores (_), hyphens (-), and periods (.).  The username cannot be changed after it is created.     |
   | Password      | Required.  The password must be 8 to 32 characters in length, and contain at least two uppercase letters, two lowercase letters, two digits, and two special characters. The supported special characters are \~ ! @ # % \^ \& \* _ - + = \` \| ( ) { } \[ \] : ; ' , . ? / |
   | Email Address | Required.   |
   | Phone number  | Optional.   |

5. Assign roles to the user.

   * You can select from existing roles based on your needs. You must select at least one role.

   * If the existing roles cannot satisfy your needs, you can click **Create Role** in the upper-right corner to create a role and assign it to the new user. For more information, see [Create a role](../1000.system-management-features/200.create-a-role.md).

   * Maximum connection attempts

     Specify the maximum number of times the user can access OCP per unit time.

     Specify the maximum number of times the user can access hosts, tenants, alerts, and monitoring resources per unit time.
