# View the performance and SQL monitoring data of a tenant

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) allows you to view the performance and SQL monitoring data of a tenant from the following entries:

* **Entry 1**:

   Log on to the OCP console and go to the **Overview** page of the target tenant. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Performance Monitoring**.

* **Entry 2:**

   Log on to the OCP console. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Monitoring and Alerts** > **Monitoring**. Go to the **OceanBase Database Tenant** tab.

## Prerequisites

You have the read-only permission on the target tenant.

## Procedure

The following procedure takes Entry 2 as an example.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Monitoring and Alerts > Monitoring**.

3. Click the **OceanBase Database Tenant** tab.

4. In the **Data Filtering** section, configure the conditions for filtering monitoring data.

   The following table describes the filter conditions.

   | Filter condition | Description |
   |---------------|---------|
   | Cluster | This parameter is not displayed in auto-refresh mode. Select a cluster to view its monitoring information.  |
   | Zone | By default, the monitoring information of all zones is displayed.  |
   | OBServer | By default, the monitoring information of all OBServer nodes is displayed.  |
   | Select Time | This parameter is not displayed in auto-refresh mode.  Select a time range for the data that you want to query.  |

5. The **Host Performance** tab automatically appears. You can view the performance and SQL monitoring data of tenants on this tab.

   If the statistical range covers multiple OBServer nodes, the aggregate metric values of the OBServer nodes are displayed.

   * Filter data:

      1. View the trend details of a metric over a specific period of time: To use this feature, drag the pointer over a period of time to select this period. The system will then zoom in to display the trend details. To resume to the normal view, double-click the trend chart, as indicated by ① in the preceding figure.

      2. Hide the data of a submetric: To use this feature, click the icon of this submetric. The submetric will then turn gray and its data will be hidden from the chart, as indicated by ② in the preceding figure.

      3. View the detailed data of a specific point in time: To use this feature, hover the pointer over a point in time on the trend chart, as indicated by ③ in the preceding figure.

   * Zoom in on the trend chart: To use this feature, click the zoom-in icon in the upper-right corner. The features indicated by ①, ②, and ③ in the preceding figure are also applicable to a zoomed-in chart.

   * View SQL request analysis. On the **Response Time** trend chart, click **SQL Request Analysis** in the upper-right corner to view the request analysis details. For more information, see [View request analysis](../../1000.diagnosis-and-tuning-fuctions/100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1300.view-request-analysis.md).

     <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>SQL request analysis is available only on the <strong>Response Time</strong> trend chart. </p>
      </main>

   * Drill down to view monitoring data in different dimensions: When an abnormal metric exists, such as a long response time of a tenant, perform a drill-down analysis to identify the faulty server. To view the drill-down analysis details, click the **Drill-down Analysis** icon in the upper-right corner of the trend chart. The **Performance & SQL** tab supports the following drill-down dimensions: tenant > OBServer node.

      The features indicated by ①, ②, and ③ in the preceding figure are also applicable to a trend chart on a drill-down page. You can also perform the following operations:

      ![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/420/sql%E4%B8%8B%E9%92%BB%E7%9B%91%E6%8E%A7-1.png)

      * In the **Data Filtering** section indicated by ① in the figure, specify filter conditions. If you do not specify any filter conditions, the drill-down page automatically inherits filter conditions from the upper-level page.

      * If the metric has submetrics, you can view the submetrics or drill down to other dimensions, as indicated by ② in the figure.

      * The trend chart provides the **Search for SQL Statement with Most Requests** link, as indicated by ③ in the figure, for you to view the TopSQL diagnostic details of the tenant.

      * The trend chart also provides an entry to the host performance monitoring feature. Hover the pointer over the **Go to Host Performance Monitoring** link, as indicated by ④ in the figure, and click the target host to go to its **Performance Monitoring** page and view the monitoring details.

      * You can also click the icon indicated by ⑤ in the upper-right corner of a trend chart, and select the hosts whose performance monitoring data needs to be displayed on the trend chart.
