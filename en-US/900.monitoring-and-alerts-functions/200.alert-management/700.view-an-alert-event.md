# View alert events

This topic describes how to view details about an alert event and temporarily block an alert event.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Monitoring and Alerts** **>** **Alerts**.

3. By default, the **Alert Events** tab appears.

4. Specify search criteria in the search area. All alert events that match the search criteria will be displayed in the **Alert Events** list.

   * You can search for alert events by **Alert Status**, **Alert Level**, **Start Time**, **End Time**, **Keyword**, **Application**, and **Alert Scope**. Exact match is supported.

   * You can click **Export Alert Event** to export all alert events that match the search criteria to your computer.

   * If alert pushes are configured for the alert event, you can click **Failed** in the **Message Push** column to view details about the alert event.

   * If no alert push is configured for the alert event, you can click **Message Push Not Configured** in the **Message Push** column to configure alert pushes for the alert event. For more information, see [Create an alert push](600.manage-alert-push/100.create-an-alert-push.md).

   3. View the alert notification history in the **Alert Messages** list.

   4. On the details page of the alert event, click **Mask Alerts** in the upper-right corner to block alert messages.

      Then the alert will not be reported before the block period expires.

   5. On the details page of the alert event, click **Alert Analysis Data** in the upper-right corner to download the logs related to alert analysis.

6. When many alert events are received, you can clear alert messages as needed.

   1. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** > **Parameter Management**.
   2. Search for the `ocp.alarm.notification.expired-days` parameter in the parameter list to set the retention period of alert messages, in days.

   After you specify this parameter, the alert messages and alert events that exceed the retention period will be deleted. The following data will be deleted upon expiration:

      * `ocp2_alarm_notification`
      * `ocp_alarm_event_notification`
      * `ocp2_alarm_event_history`
      * `ocp_alarm_event_record`
      * `ocp2_alarm_filter` (Cleared data will be written to `ocp2_alarm_filter_history`. The amount of rule information is small and therefore the rule history table does not need to be cleared.)

     <main id="notice" type='alert'>
     <h4>Notice</h4>
     <p><ul><li>We recommend that you set the alert clearing period to a proper value, for example, several months. </li><li>Alerts must not be left uncleared and unhandled for a long time. You can configure alert message push. We recommend that you promptly handle received alert messages. </li><ul></p>
     </main>
