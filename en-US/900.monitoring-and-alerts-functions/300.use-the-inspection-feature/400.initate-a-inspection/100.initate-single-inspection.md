# Initiate an inspection for a single object

This topic describes how to initiate an inspection for a single object. If you want to initiate a global inspection, see [Initiate a global inspection](../400.initate-a-inspection/200.initiate-global-inspection.md).

## Background information

After you initiate an inspection, OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) immediately starts inspection based on the inspection rule. For more information, see [Inspection](../100.inspection-management.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Monitoring and Alert > Inspection**.

2. Wait until the **Inspection List** page appears.

3. Click the tab containing the target inspection object.

4. Select the object you want to inspect from the list, move the pointer over **Initiate Inspection** in the **Actions** column, and select an inspection scenario from the drop-down list.
