# Initiate a global inspection

This topic describes how to initiate a global inspection. If you want to inspect a single object, see [Initiate an inspection for a single object](../400.initate-a-inspection/100.initate-single-inspection.md).

## Background information

After you initiate an inspection, OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) immediately starts to inspect the OceanBase clusters, OceanBase tenants, and OBProxy clusters managed in OCP based on the inspection items. For more information, see [Inspection](../100.inspection-management.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Monitoring and Alert > Inspection**.

2. Wait until the **Inspection List** page appears.

3. Move the pointer over **Initiate Global Inspection** in the upper-right corner and select an inspection scenario from the drop-down list.

4. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>If a cluster is being inspected for the selected scenario, the cluster is skipped.</li>
    <li>If a host is being inspected for the selected scenario, the host is skipped.</li>
    </ul>
    </main>
