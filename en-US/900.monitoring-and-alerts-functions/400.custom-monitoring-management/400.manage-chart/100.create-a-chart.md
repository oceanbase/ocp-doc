# Create a chart

This topic describes how to create a chart. OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) allows you to create a chart to display the execution results of custom metrics.

## Procedure

You can create a chart by using the following three methods:

* **Method 1**: On the **Custom Monitoring** page, click **Create Chart** in the upper-right corner.
* **Method 2**: If no charts are created, go to the **Custom Monitoring** page, and click **Create Chart** on the **Charts** tab.
* **Method 3**: If you have created a metric, go to the **Custom Monitoring** page and click the **Metrics** tab, where you can create a chart for the metric.

The following procedure demonstrates how to use **Method 1**.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Monitoring and Alerts > Custom Monitoring**.

3. On the **Custom Monitoring** page, click **Create Chart** in the upper-right corner.

4. In the panel that appears on the right, set the parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |------|---------|
   | Chart Name | The name of the chart. The name can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and underscores (_), and must be 2 to 48 characters in length.  |
   | Chart Description | The additional information about the chart.  |
   | Chart Position | The location where the chart is displayed. Valid values:<ul><li>Clusters - Database Performance</li><li>Clusters - Host Performance</li><li>Tenants - Performance and SQL</li><li>Tenants - Transactions</li><li>Tenants - Storage and Cache</li><li>OBProxy - System Monitoring</li><li>Hosts - Monitoring - Host Performance</li><li>Hosts - Monitoring - Host Resources</li></ul> <main id="notice" type='note'><h4>Note</h4><p>When you create a chart for specific metrics, the chart location is automatically generated based on the metrics. </p></main> |
   | Monitoring Metrics | <ul><li>**Selected Metric**: Select a metric from the drop-down list. The selected metric is associated with the chart location. If the required metric does not exist in the drop-down list, you can click **Add Metric** at the bottom of the list to create a metric. For more information, see [Create a metric](../300.manage-indicator-items/100.create-a-indicator-item.md). <br>In the **Selected Metric** drop-down list, you can select built-in and custom metrics of OCP. For more information about built-in metrics of OCP, see [Overview](../../../1900.reference-guide/300.monitoring-indicator-reference/100.overview-of-metrics.md). </li><li>**Displayed Metric Name**: the displayed name of the selected metric. This parameter is automatically filled based on the selected metric, and can be modified. </li><li>**Metric Description**: the description of the selected metric. This parameter is automatically filled based on the selected metric, and can be modified. </li><li>**Unit**: The unit of the selected metric. This parameter is automatically filled based on the selected metric, and can be modified. </li></ul><main id="notice" type='note'><h4>Note</h4><p><ul><li>To use multiple metrics in the chart, click **add a row of data** to add a metric. To remove a metric, click **Delete** in the **Actions** column. </li><li>The system consumes server resources to query the monitoring data of a metric. If you use multiple metrics in a chart and server resources are insufficient, data queries are slow. We recommend that you add metrics based on the actual server resources. </li></ul></p></main> |
   | Graphic Style | The style of the chart. Only line charts are supported.  |
