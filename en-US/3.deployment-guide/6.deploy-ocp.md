# Deploy OCP

This topic describes how to deploy OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Community Edition.
You can deploy OCP by using the command-line interface (CLI) tool or a browser.

> **Note**
>
> * Only OCP V3.3.0-BP1 and later can be deployed by using a browser.
> * Pages in the browser can be displayed only in English.

## Deploy OCP by using the CLI tool

### Prerequisites

* The OCP Docker container has been installed on the central control server. For more information about how to install a Docker container, see [Install Docker](9.deploy-appendix/1.install-docker.md).

* You have decompressed the `ocp-3.3.0-ce.tar.gz` software package to a directory on the central control server. For more information, see [Prepare for installation](4.installation-preparation.md). The package contains the following files:

  * `ocp_installer.sh`: the OCP installation script.

  * `ocp.tar.gz`: the OCP image file.

  * `ocp-installer.tar.gz`: the OCP installer image file.

  * `config.yaml`: the OCP configuration file.
* You have modified the OCP configuration file based on your actual deployment environment. For more information, see [Modify the configuration file](5.modify-conf-file.md).

### Procedure

1. Log on to the central control server as the root user and go to the directory where the `ocp_installer.sh` file is located.
2. Optional. Call the `ocp_installer.sh` file to view the OCP deployment method.

   ```bash
   #./ocp_installer.sh help
   Usage:
   ./ocp_installer.sh COMMAND -c config_file -i installer_image_file [-o ocp_image_file] [-k ssh_key_file] [-v] [-h]
   Description:
   OCP installer
   Commands:
   install      install OCP
   uninstall    delete OCP and metadb(if configured)
   upgrade      upgrade OCP
   replace      replace OCP container, used for upgrade to the bp version, or just restart
   Options:
   -c           required, path to config file
   -i           installer image file
   -o           ocp image file
   -k           ssh_key_file
   -v           show verbose messages
   -h           show this help mesages
   ```

3. Run the following command to deploy OCP:

   ```bash
   # Use password for Secure Shell (SSH) authentication.
   ./ocp_installer.sh install -c config.yaml -i ./ocp-installer.tar.gz -o ./ocp.tar.gz
   # Use key for SSH authentication.
   ./ocp_installer.sh install -c config.yaml -k /root/.ssh/id_rsa -i ./ocp-installer.tar.gz -o ./ocp.tar.gz
   ```

   Usage:
   ./ocp_installer.sh COMMAND -c config_file -i installer_image_file [-o ocp_image_file] [-k ssh_key_file] [-v] [-h]
   Description:
   OCP installer

   Commands:
    launch       launch installer
    install      install OCP
    uninstall    delete OCP and metadb(if configured)
    upgrade      upgrade OCP
    replace      replace OCP container, used for upgrade to the bp version, or just restart

   Options:
    -c           required, path to config file
    -i           installer image file
    -o           ocp image file
    -k           ssh_key_file
    -v           show verbose messages
    -p           expose port of installer container
    -h           show this help mesages
   ```

3. Run the following command to start the ocp_installer:

   ```bash
   # To use the default parameters, run the following command. In this case, the image file in the current directory, id_rsa file of the current user, and Port 3000 are used.
   ./ocp_installer.sh launch
   # To use custom parameters, run the following command and specify the image file, key file, and port number.
   ./ocp_installer.sh launch -i ocp-installer.tar.gz -o ocp.tar.gz -k /root/.ssh/id_rsa -p 3000
   ```

4. Use the corresponding IP address and port in the `IP:port` format to access the deployment page in a browser. On the page that appears, click **Install**.

5. Add the hosts on which you want to deploy OCP, and then click **Next**.
   You need to specify the following information: the username and port used to connect to the hosts, the authentication method, and IP addresses of the hosts.

   > **Note**
   >
   > OCP supports SSH authentication based on a password or a private key. To use a private key for the authentication, you must specify the directory of the key file in the container by setting the `-k` parameter in the `ocp_installer.sh` file.

6. Specify parameters of the MetaDB and click **Next**.
   You can create a MetaDB on the **create metadb cluster** tab, or specify an existing cluster on the **use existing obcluster** tab.
   * Create a MetaDB on the **create metadb cluster** tab
      1. In the **obcluster** section, specify basic information such as the cluster name, ports, and installation directory. You can enable the advanced settings to specify keys and values of custom parameters.
         ![3](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/%E5%85%A8%E6%96%B0%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B2.png)
      2. In the **Tenant** section, specify the following information: names and resources of tenants, usernames and passwords of users in the tenants, and names of databases in the tenants.
         A MetaDB tenant and a monitor tenant are required for OCP deployment.
         ![4](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/%E7%A7%9F%E6%88%B7%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF.png)
      3. In the **Obproxy** section, specify the installation path and ports of OBProxy.
         If you have specified a virtual IP address (VIP), you can enable the **use vip** field. Then, the specified VIP is used for OCP access.
         ![5](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/obproxy.png)

   * Specify an existing cluster on the **use existing obcluster** tab
      Specify parameters of the cluster and the two tenants.

7. Specify parameters in the **OCP Deployment** section and click **Submit**.
   Parameters in the **OCP Deployment** section include the OCP container name, port, resources, and log path. If you have specified a VIP, you can enable the **use vip** field to use it. This VIP address is used to facilitate access by other components when you deploy the cluster and other services of OCP.

8. After you click **Submit**, the **Task** page appears. You can view task logs on this page. Note that the process of MetaDB initialization takes a while to complete.
   After the task is completed, click **Finish** to exit the installer. Before you exit the installer, make sure that the ocp-installer container on the host is in the installation completed state.

### Roll back the task

After the task is submitted, the task information is saved in the `./task` directory. To roll back a failed task, you can clean up the deployment environment and re-deploy OCP by using the corresponding `config.yaml`file. For more information about how to clean up the deployment environment, see [Uninstall OCP](9.deploy-appendix/2.uninstall-ocp.md).
