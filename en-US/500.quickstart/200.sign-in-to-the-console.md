# Log on to the OCP console

After you deploy OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), you can log on to the OCP console through its access address.

## Prerequisites

You have obtained the OCP logon username and password from the administrator.

## Procedure

1. Enter the OCP access address in the address bar of your browser and press the Enter key.
   OCP access address: The access address of the OCP application server (single-node deployment) or the OCP cluster.

2. Enter the OCP username and password on the logon page.

3. If the username or password you entered is incorrect, an error message appears, indicating the remaining logon attempts allowed and that the **username or password is incorrect**.

   * If the number of failed attempts exceeds the limit, the system locks the IP address of the client from which you made the failed attempts. Try again after 10 minutes. If you still cannot log on after 10 minutes, contact the administrator.
   * If you do not take any actions for 30 minutes after logon, OCP automatically logs you off.

4. Click **Log On**.

   * When you log on to the OCP console as the admin user for the first time, the system will redirect to the **Set password to activate account** page on which you need to reset your password to activate the current account. Log on to the OCP console again with the new password.

   * If you log on as other users for the first time, we recommend that you go to [Personal Center](../1600.system-management-features/600.management-user-center/100.configure-personal-information.md) to change your password and keep your new password safe.

      <p><ul><li>If you have configured the <b>Administrator Password</b> when you install OCP, you can use the password to log on to the OCP console without setting a password to activate the account. </li><li>The OCP console does not support password retrieval.<ul><li>If you forget the logon password of the admin user, contact OceanBase Technical Support for help.</li><li>If you forget the password of other users, log on to the OCP console as the admin user to reset the user password.

   * In multi-cluster deployment, when you log on to a follower OCP cluster for the first time, you need to register the follower cluster with the leader cluster. For more information, see [Register an OCP cluster](../1200.manage-disaster-recovery/300.ocp-multi-cluster-mode/200.register-an-ocp-cluster.md).

## Third-party SSO

In the upper-right corner of the OCP console, click the username and select **Log Off**. For more information, see [Log off](../1600.system-management-features/600.management-user-center/400.log-out.md).
