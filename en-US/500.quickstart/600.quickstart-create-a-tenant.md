# Create a primary tenant

A tenant can be seen as a container for database objects and resources such as CPU, memory, and I/O resources. You can create a primary tenant in a cluster based on business needs.

You can create a primary tenant in the following ways in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console:

* Create a primary tenant on the Tenants page.

* Create a primary tenant on the Tenant Management page of a specified cluster.

This topic describes how to create a primary tenant on the Tenants page.

## Prerequisites

* The cluster where you want to create a tenant is the running cluster.

* You have logged on with an account that has the permissions to manage the cluster. For example, you act as the system administrator or the OCP tenant administrator.

* Optional. You have created a parameter template by referring to [Manage tenant parameter templates](1500.manage-tenant-parameter-templates.md).

   When you need to create multiple tenants with the same parameter configuration, you can use a parameter template to avoid repeatedly configuring the same parameters.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants**. The **Tenants** page appears.

3. Click **Create Tenant** in the upper-right corner.

4. Configure the parameters in the **Basic Information** section. The required parameters and their descriptions are listed in the following table.

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |---------------|---|
   | **Tenant Type** | Select **Primary Tenant**. <blockquote>**Note**</br>If the tenant version is earlier than OceanBase Database V4.2, you cannot select a tenant type. The default value is `Primary Tenant`. </blockquote> |
   | **Select Cluster** | Select a cluster for the tenant. <blockquote>**Note**</br>When you create a primary tenant on the **Tenant Management** page of a specified cluster, the current cluster is used by default. </blockquote> |
   | **Tenant Name** | The tenant name must be 2 to 64 characters in length and can contain letters, digits, and underscores (_).  |
   | **Administrator Password** | The password of the tenant administrator account, which can be randomly generated. The administrator account is root in MySQL mode. The password must meet the following requirements:<ul><li>The length is 8 to 32 characters.</li><li>The password contains at least two uppercase letters, two lowercase letters, two digits, and two special characters. </li><li>The supported special characters are ~ ! @ # % \ ^ & * _ - + = ` | ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' , . ? / </li> </ul> |
   | **Character Set and Encoding** | The supported character sets are utf8mb4, binary, gbk, gb18030, and latin1. The default character set is utf8mb4.   |
   | **Collation** | The detailed collation corresponding to the specified character set.  |
   | **Remarks** | This parameter is optional and allows you to add additional information.  |

5. Configure the parameters in the **Replica Settings** section.

   By default, the system displays configurable zones based on the zone information of the selected cluster. If you do not need to create a replica in a zone, click the Delete icon to delete the zone. The zone information parameters that need to be configured and their descriptions are listed in the following table.

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |----------------|------|
   | **Replica Type** | The type of the replica. Valid values: <ul><li>Full-featured Replica</li><li> Read-only Replica   </li><li> Log Replica</li></ul>    Select multiple full-featured replicas to ensure that they are in the majority.  <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>In a **standalone centralized** database, only **full-featured replicas** are supported. </p></main> |
   | **Unit Specification** | OCP has a set of built-in unit specifications. You can select the specifications that you need from the list of unit specifications or click [Add Specification](500.ocp-resource-unit-specifications.md) at the bottom of the list to add custom specifications. For more information, see **OCP resource unit specifications**. <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p><ul><li>We recommend that you set the same specifications and number of units for full-featured replicas. Different specifications or numbers of units can affect performance or stability. </li><li>If the cluster version is OceanBase Database V4.0.0 or later, the unit specifications are limited by default. If you want to use specifications lower than the default specifications, you can modify the <code>__min_full_resource_pool_memory</code> parameter to adjust the minimum values for the unit specifications. For example, if your cluster version is OceanBase Database V4.1.0, you can modify the parameter by referring to the  <a href="https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-10000000001697240">Modify cluster parameters</a> topic. </li></ul></p></main> |
   | **Units** | The number of units in the zone. The number of resource units cannot exceed the number of OBServer nodes in the zone. <ul><li>If the cluster version is OceanBase Database V4.0 or later, you can only set the same number of units for all zones, which is 1 by default. </li><li>If the cluster version is earlier than OceanBase Database V4.0, you can set different numbers of units for different zones. </li><main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>In a **standalone centralized** database, the default number of units is **1**, which cannot be modified. </p></main> |
   | **Zone Priority Rankings** | Specifies whether to define priorities for the zones of the tenant. The priorities affect the priority of the primary zone of the sys tenant. <ul><li>If this parameter is not specified, the zone priorities of the sys tenant are used by default. </li><li>If **Zone Priority Rankings** is enabled while no zone priorities, the random priority is used. </li> <li>To configure zone priorities, you can select one or more zones from the list on the left that displays all zones in the current cluster and add the selected zones to the list on the right. By default, the priority of a zone added earlier is higher than that of a zone added later, and the zones added at the same time have the same priority.  After you move the zones to the box on the right side, you can also drag them upward or downward to adjust their priority order. A zone takes priority over those beneath it. </li></ul><main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>In a **standalone centralized** database, the zone priority rankings are not displayed, and Zone1 has the highest priority. </p></main> |

6. Configure the parameters in the **Security Settings** section.

   * **Access from all IP addresses is supported**: This tenant can be accessed by any IP address.

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <p>This mode causes access security risks. Proceed with caution. </p>
      </main>

   * **Custom**: You can add allowed clients into the allowlist in the formats described in the following table. Example:

      | Format | Example |
      |--------|-------|
      | IP address | xxx.xxx.xxx.1,xxx.xxx.xxx.2 |
      | Subnet/Mask | xxx.xxx.xxx.1/24 |
      | Fuzzy match | xxx.xxx.xxx.% or xxx.xxx.xxx._ |
      | Mixed | xxx.xxx.xxx.1,xxx.xxx.xxx.2,xxx.xxx.xxx.%,xxx.xxx.xxx._,xxx.xxx.xxx.1/24 |
      | % | % indicates that all clients can connect to this tenant. |

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <p>You must add the IP addresses of the OCP and OBProxy servers to the allowlist. Otherwise, you cannot manage the tenant from OCP. </p>
      </main>

7. Enable **Parameter Configurations** and configure the tenant parameters.

   * You can click the button in section ① of the following figure to add startup parameters one by one and set their values.

   * You can also click **Select Parameter Template** as shown in section ② of the following figure and select a parameter template. The system will automatically populate parameters in this section by using the template.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <ul>
   <li>If you are creating a tenant in MySQL mode by using a parameter template that contains parameters that are valid only in Oracle mode, you must manually delete those parameters. </li>
   <li>If no tenant parameter template is available, you can click <strong>Create Tenant Parameter Template</strong> to create one. For more information, see <a href="1500.manage-tenant-parameter-templates.md">Manage tenant parameter templates</a>. </li>
   </ul>
