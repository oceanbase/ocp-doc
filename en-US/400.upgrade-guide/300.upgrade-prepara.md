# Preparations

Before you upgrade OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), evaluate the upgrade process based on the information provided in [Considerations](200.upgrade-notice.md) and make adequate preparations. We recommend that you evaluate the impact and mitigate risks in advance.

The preparations for the upgrade include the following aspects:

* Deploy OceanBase Admin Toolkit (OAT) in advance.

* Evaluate whether the software and hardware configurations of the original version support the upgrade.

* Evaluate the impact of the upgrade process on OCP services, including service downtime and monitoring data collection interruption.

* Make sure that no O&M operation is being performed in OCP, such as adding hosts, software packages, or scaling OceanBase Database.

* Perform thorough testing before upgrading the production environment.

* For any concerns about the upgrade process, contact OCP Technical Support.

* Check whether the connection credentials of each host are stored in the password box. For more information, see [Manage connection credentials of a host](../1600.system-management-features/600.management-user-center/300.manage-password-box/100.create-connection.md).

* Understand the mapping between the versions of OCP and OAT. For more information, see [Version mappings](600.upgrade-appendix/200.version-supporting-relationship.md).
