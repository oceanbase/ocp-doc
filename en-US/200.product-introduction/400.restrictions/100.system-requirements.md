# System requirements

This topic describes the system requirements for OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), including hardware requirements, software requirements, operating system requirements, and client requirements.

## Hardware requirements

OCP-Server can be installed on a physical server or in a Docker container. OCP-Server supports multi-node and high-availability deployments.

The following table lists the minimum hardware requirements for an OCP-Server node.

| **Hardware** |                                         **Requirement**                                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CPU          | <li>x86_64 architecture, 8-core processor</li><li>  ARM AArch64 architecture, 8-core processor</li> |
| Memory       | 16 GB available                                                                                  |
| NIC          | 10 Gbit/s NIC                                                                                    |

OCP-Agent takes up few resources and has no special hardware requirements.

## Software requirements

### OCP-Server software requirements

If you install OCP by using Docker images, the required software is already contained in the Docker image package.

The following table describes the software requirements for installing OCP by using RPM packages.

| **Software** |                      **Version**                       |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| JDK          | Oracle JDK (1.8 and later) or Ali JDK (V1.8 and later) |
| Python       | 2.7.5 and later                                        |

Some third-party Python packages are also downloaded during the OCP-Server installation. OCP-Init depend on the third-party Python packages.

Content of requirement.txt, the dependency requirement file, of OCP-Server:
