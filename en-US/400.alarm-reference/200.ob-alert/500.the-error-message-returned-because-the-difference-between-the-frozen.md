The value of the **metric** ob_cluster_frozen_version_delta indicates the difference between the major freeze version number and the baseline version number of the OceanBase cluster. When the difference exceeds the threshold, this alert is triggered. The default threshold is 1.

**Alert rule**
-----------------------------------



|             Metric              | Default threshold | Duration  | Detection cycle | Time before clearance |
|---------------------------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| ob_cluster_frozen_version_delta | 1                 | 0 seconds | 60 seconds      | 5 minutes             |



**Alert information**
------------------------------------------



|  Trigger method   | Alert level |  Scope  |
|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| Metric expression | Critical    | Cluster |



**Alert templates**
----------------------------------------

* Overview: \${alarm_target} ${alarm_name}



* Details: \${alarm_target} \${alarm_name}. The version difference is \${value}, exceeding the threshold of ${alarm_threshold}.



* Overview example: ob_cluster=C1-1000. The difference between the major freeze version number and the baseline version number of the OceanBase cluster exceeds the threshold.



* Details example: ob_cluster=C1-1000. The difference between the major freeze version number and the baseline version number of the OceanBase cluster is 2.0, exceeding the threshold of 1.0.






**Impact on the system**
---------------------------------------------

This problem affects the statement response time. In extreme cases, the OBServer memory is overused, the application stops writing, and the clog disk is full.

**Possible causes**
----------------------------------------

This problem is commonly found in the following scenarios:

* You start a major compaction task when an OceanBase cluster is undergoing an automatic compaction.



* You continuously start several major compaction tasks.



* You start a new major compaction task before the last major compaction is finished.






Suggested solutions
----------------------------------------

1. You can check the following information to determine the causes that triggered the alert.

   * Choose **Compaction Management \> Details of Major Freeze** in the left-side navigation pane of a cluster and view the information of the latest major compaction.



   * Choose **System Management \> Tasks** in the left-side navigation pane and view the major compaction tasks.






2. Perform the following steps based on the causes.

   * Ignore the alert caused by the manual major compaction task. Wait for the task to complete.

     Note: Start a major compaction task only when it is necessary.


   * A slow or failed major compaction task also triggers other alerts at the same time, such as the [ob_cluster_merge_error](../200.ob-alert/600.a-ob_cluster_merge_error-ob-cluster-merge-error-occurs.md) and the [ob_cluster_merge_timeout](../200.ob-alert/700.ob_cluster_merge_timeout-ob-cluster-merge-timeout.md) alerts.

     You can solve the problem of those alerts before starting a major compaction task and check whether the alert is triggered again.


   * For other exceptions, go to the next step.






3. Try to troubleshoot the problem on your own. For more information, see [Exception handling for OceanBase cluster compaction](../400.alarm-appendix/300.handle-oceanbase-cluster-merge-exceptions.md).
