OCP-Agent script 
=====================================

This topic describes how to use the ocp_agent_ctl.py script. 

Environment 
--------------------------------

After you install the software packages of OCP-Agent and OCP-Server, you can find the `ocp_agent_ctl.py` script in the following directories:

* OCP-Server: `/home/admin/ocp-server/lib`

  

* OCP-Agent: `/home/admin/ocp_agent`

  To run the `ocp_agent_ctl.py` script, you must have Python V2.7.5 and the`pos.py` script. The `pos.py` script is used to perform host operations. It is included in the software packages of OCP-Agent and OCP-Server. Therefore, you can run `ocp_agent_ctl.py` directly in `/home/admin/ocp-server/lib` or `/home/admin/ocp_agent`.
