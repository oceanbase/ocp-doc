Overview 
=============================

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Community Edition provides small and medium enterprises with essential OceanBase management features, so that the enterprises can for example manage hosts and perform O\&M operations on OceanBase clusters and OceanBase Database tenants. 

OCP is an enterprise-level database management platform with OceanBase Database as its core. The latest version of OCP supports all major versions of OceanBase Database from V1.4 to V2.3.x, and allows enterprises to manage hosts and perform O\&M operations on OceanBase clusters and OceanBase Database tenants. Other features such as backup and recovery, multi-cluster and multi-zone modes, and precise monitoring and alerting are also supported in the latest version. 

OCP Community Edition is suitable for small and medium enterprises. It is a tailored edition that can be independently deployed and used with limited resources. Essential features are retained in this edition to meet basic requirements for the O\&M of OceanBase clusters and OceanBase Database tenants.

To install OCP Community Edition, you can perform the following steps:

* Deploy MetaDB and MonitorDB

  MetaDB and MonitorDB are the databases that OCP depends on.
  * MetaDB stores persistent data of OCP except for the monitoring data.

    
  
  * MonitorDB stores the performance data collected by OCP from managed objects, mainly OceanBase Database clusters.

    
  

  

  You must create two OceanBase Database tenants to host MetaDB and MonitorDB respectively.
  

* Deploy OCP

  You can execute scripts to deploy OCP Community Edition in a Docker container.
