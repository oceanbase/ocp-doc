Deploy OBD 
===============================

OceanBase Deployer (OBD) is a tool used to install and deploy open source software of OceanBase. 

Procedure 
------------------------------

1. Log on to the server on which you want to deploy OBD as the root user.

   

2. Install OBD. 

   * If the server can connect to the Internet and allows installation of third-party software from a YUM repository, you can run the following commands to install OBD from the official source of OceanBase software. 

     > **Notice**
     >
     > This operation is supported only on Anolis, CentOS, and RedHat.

     ```shell
     yum install -y yum-utils
     yum-config-manager --add-repo https://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase/OceanBase.repo
     yum install -y ob-deploy
     ```

     

     After you run the `obd cluster deploy` command, OBD checks the target server for the OceanBase Database installation package. If the package does not exist, OBD automatically obtains the package from the YUM repository.
     
   
   * If the server cannot connect to the Internet, you can download the installation package in advance from the official website of OceanBase Database. 

     For more information about where to download the OBD software package, see [Prepare for the installation](../4.installation-preparation.md). After you download the OBD software package, upload it to the target server, and run the corresponding command to install OBD. 
     * On CentOS or RedHat, run the following command:

       ```shell
       yum install ob-deploy-1.1.0-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
       ```

       
     
     * On Ubuntu or Debian, run the following command:

       ```shell
       alien --scripts -i ob-deploy-1.1.0-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
       ```

       
     

     
   

   

3. Run the following command to start OBD: 

   ```shell
   source /etc/profile.d/obd.sh
   ```
