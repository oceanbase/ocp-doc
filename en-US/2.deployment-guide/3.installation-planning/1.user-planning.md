| root  | The user for uploading software packages and granting permissions. It is a built-in user of the system. You do not need to create it.                                                                                           |
| admin | The business user for performing OCP operations and operations related to OCP. You need to manually create an admin user for each host. For more information, see **Create an admin user**. |



Create an admin user 
-----------------------------------------

To create an admin user, you can perform the following steps: 

1. Run the following commands to create the admin user: 

   ```bash
   useradd -U admin -d /home/admin -s /bin/bash
   mkdir -p /home/admin
   sudo chown -R admin:admin /home/admin
   ```

   
   

2. Run the following command to set a password for the admin user: 

   ```shell
   passwd admin
   ```

   
   

3. Optional. Set sudo permissions for the admin user. 

   Open the `/etc/sudoers` file. Add the following code to `/etc/sudoers`:

   ```shell
   ## Same thing without a password
   # %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
   admin       ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

   
   

4. Run the following command in the `/home` directory to check whether the admin user is granted the permission to access the directory. 

   ```shell
   ls --al
   ```

   

   The following output is returned:

   ```shell
   drwxr-xr-x 2 admin admin 4096 Feb. 9 18:43 
   drwxr-xr-x 2 admin admin 4096 Feb. 9 18:43 admin
   ```

   

   If the admin user does not have the access permission, run the following commands as the root user:

   ```shell
   chown -R admin:admin /data
   chown -R admin:admin /home/admin
   ```

   

   Note that you need to specify your actual mount directories. The `/data`, `/redo`, and `/home/admin` directories in the preceding commands are only examples for your reference.
