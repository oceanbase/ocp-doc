Set an alert-blocking condition 
====================================================



All alert-blocking conditions are displayed on the **Alert Blocking** tab. By default, the alert-blocking conditions created by the user who has logged on are displayed. 

* An alert-blocking condition takes at most 30 seconds to take effect after it is created.

  

* The alert-blocking conditions that have expired for more than seven days will be automatically archived.

  

* When you run an O\&M task on an OceanBase cluster, alerts are automatically blocked.
